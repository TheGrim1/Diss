	abstract = {A computer code for the simulation of ion beam irradiation of nanostructures has been developed. The code simulates the transport of energetic ions through matter by means of a Monte Carlo algorithm, similar to the often-used TRIM code (Ziegler et al. (1985) [1]). New effects occur compared to bulk, when irradiating nanostructures, which are of the same size as the ion range or the damage cascade. To account for these effects, the target in our code does not consist of layers like in TRIM but can be defined as an arbitrary 3-dimensional structure. This allows to obtain more accurate 3D distributions of implanted ions and implantation damage for nanostructures, which cannot be described by a stack of layers. We demonstrate the functionality of the code by comparing simulations with ion beam implantation into nanowires.},

	abstract = {Among the various radiation effects which involve the study of radiation environments, responses of materials and devices to radiation, radiation testing and radiation hardening of devices and equipment, this review mainly considers the radiation effects induced by alpha particles and other ions used in semiconductor technology on Si crystals and Si devices.We first describe the single-ion microprobe that enables the study of the site dependence of radiation hardness in a semiconductor device. Next, we describe single-ion implantation as a tool for suppressing fluctuation in device function induced by the discrete number and random position of dopant atoms. Finally, we describe the common features associated with both 'probing' and 'modification' in terms of the nature and behaviour of defect clusters induced by single-ion irradiation.A special feature of the review is that the radiation effects discussed here are induced by 'single' particles, and not by particle beams. Although there is a great amount of accumulated data on radiation effects, they are discussed in the conventional terms of 'dose' or 'fluence,' whose unit is cm−2. Therefore, this review provides complementary information on radiation effects.},

This is caused by the influence of the cavities on the evolution of collision cascades, but also by the differing heat conduction which affects the spike phase. Using molecular dynamics simulation we study the sputtering of a Au nanofoam by 10 keV Au projectiles, and compare to the sputtering of a compact Au target. These bombardment conditions lead to a strong contribution of spikes to the sputtering process. We find the foam to sputter considerably less than the compact target; the open structure of the foam prevents the build-up of strong collision spike regions at the surface, which are the major source of sputtering in the compact target. Also emission takes a longer time scale in the foam, as particles need to travel longer pathways to be emitted. On the other hand, the molten phase is more extended in the foam and also exists for a longer time; this is caused by the reduced heat conductivity in this material.},

The nanowires with the lowest Mn concentration (similar to 0.0001\%) exhibit a low resistance of a few k Omega at 300 K and a 4\% positive MR at 1.6 K, which can be well described by invoking a spin-split subband model. In contrast, nanowires with the highest Mn concentration (4\%) display a large resistance of several M Omega at 300 K and a large negative MR of 85\% at 1.6 K. The large negative MR is interpreted in terms of spin-dependent hopping in a complex magnetic nanowire landscape of magnetic polarons, separated by intermediate regions of Mn impurity spins. Sweeping the magnetic field back and forth for the 4\% sample reveals a hysteresis that indicates the presence of a weak ferromagnetic phase. We propose co-doping with Zn to be a promising way to reach the goal of realizing ferromagnetic Ga1-xMnxAs nanowires for future nanospintronics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {Ionenstrahlimplantation ist eine nützliche und weit verbreitete Methode um Materialien zu dotieren. Nanostrukturen verhalten sich unter Ionenbestrahlung oft deutlich anders als das entsprechende Volumenmaterial; zum Beispiel unterscheiden sich die erzeugten Dotierprofile sowie die Erzeugung und das Ausheilen von Defekten. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird dieses Unterschiedliche Verhalten unter Ionenbestrahlung von drei Gesichtspunkten aus untersucht:
Im ersten Teil wird ein neu entwickeltes Computerprogramm zur Simulation der Ionenbestrahlung von Nanostrukturen vorgestellt und diskutiert. Ähnlich wie bei vergleichbaren Programmen wird dabei ein Monte-Carlo-Algorithmus in Kombination mit der Zweierstoß-Näherung verwendet. Im Gegensatz zu konventionellen Programmen wird das Target aber durch kleine Zellen und nicht durch Schichten repräsentiert, so dass sich beliebige Nanostrukturen dreidimensional abbilden lassen. Die erzielten Simulationsergebnisse stimmen gut mit experimentellen Befunden überein.
Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wird die ionenstrahlinduzierte Verbiegung von Nanodrähten untersucht. Je nach Energie der Ionen lassen sich die Nanodrähte in verschiedene Richtungen verbiegen und ausrichten. Als zugrundeliegender Mechanismus wird die inhomogene Verteilung verschiedener ionenstrahlinduzierter Defekte identifiziert.
Der dritte Teil beschäftigt sich mit der Dotierung von GaAs-Nanodrähten mittels Mangan. Wegen der geringen Löslichkeit der Übergangsmetalle in III-V-Halbleitern kann das Mangan nicht beim Wachstum der Nanodrähte eingebracht werden. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Mangan-Dotierung von GaAs mittels Ionenstrahlimplantation möglich ist. Dabei ist eine erhöhte Implantationstemperatur erforderlich, um das in Nanodrähten ohnehin verstärkte dynamische Ausheilen noch weiter zu unterstützen und die Kristallinität der Nanodrähte zu erhalten. Alle drei Teile zeigen deutliche Unterschiede bei der Ionenbestrahlung von Nanodrähten im Vergleich zum Volumenmaterial.},

We studied two approaches for the preparation of Mn-doped GaAs NWs: First, ion implantation at room temperature with subsequent annealing resulted in polycrystalline NWs and phase segregation of MnAs and GaAs. The second approach was ion implantation at elevated temperatures. In this case, the single-crystallinity of the GaAs NWs was maintained, and crystalline, highly Mn-doped GaAs NWs were obtained. The electrical resistance of such NWs dropped with increasing temperature (activation energy about 70 meV). Corresponding magnetoresistance measurements showed a decrease at low temperatures, indicating paramagnetism. Our findings suggest possibilities for future applications where dense arrays of GaMnAs nanowires may be used as a new kind of magnetic material system.},

The program is based on the well-known TRIDYN code which describes dynamic modifications along one dimension. In a computational volume composed of fixed and equisized voxels, local atomic density changes due to ion implantation or recoil relocation are relaxed to constant predefined atomic volumes. This is accomplished by interaction with neighboring voxels and by material transport towards and away from the surface. Arbitrary initial system shapes and elemental distributions can be defined as well as a wide range of irradiation conditions including non-uniform beam profiles. The paper addresses details of the involved algorithms and discusses potential artifacts with respect to surface sputtering, broadening of compositional profiles, and surface contours. It demonstrates the capabilities of the program by examples of focused ion beam erosion, self-organized surface pattering, and ion implantation and sputter-shaping of nanostructures.},

We use Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation to study this process, with 20 keV Ar impact on a-Si clusters as a prototypical example. The sputter yield is quantified as being influenced by oblique incidence and target curvature. Cluster radii R are scaled to the energy deposition depth, a. For large R (R/a{\textgreater}5) sphere sputtering follows closely the sputtering of planar targets, if the variation of the incidence angle on the sphere surface is taken into account. For smaller radii, the yield increases due to the influence of curvature. For radii R/a≲1 pronounced forward sputtering leads to a maximum in the sputter yield. For smaller R, sputter emission becomes isotropic, but decreases in magnitude since not all the projectile energy is deposited in the sphere. However, for all spheres studied (R≥0.05a) the average sputter yield is larger than for infinitely large spheres (R→∞). A simple model based on linear collision cascade theory and assuming that the energy deposition profile is independent of the sphere size predicts sputtering for large spheres well, but fails for small spheres where it strongly underestimates sputtering. The MC data for the smaller spheres are supplemented by MD calculations, which indicate a significant additional contribution caused by spike sputtering.},

	abstract = {In situ wafer curvature measurements were performed during amorphization of silicon by MeV ion implantation. These measurements provide information about density changes and plastic phenomena in the implanted region. Experiments were performed for a variety of ions, a range of fluxes, and for temperatures between −175 and 200 °C. In all cases, the implanted region expanded due to the creation of damaged crystal, creating compressive stress in the implanted region on the order of 108 N/m2. Once heavily damaged or amorphous regions were formed, radiation‐enhanced plastic flow of material out of the plane of the wafer occurred in order to relieve the stress created by the expansion. The value of the shear viscosity responsible for this phenomena could be measured by comparing samples with the same history but different stresses. For 2‐MeV Xe implantation at room temperature and 1011 ions/cm2 s, the radiation‐enhanced shear viscosity is ∼ 1013 Ns/m2, which is at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the thermally activated shear viscosity. Possible contributions to flow from a homogeneous distribution of broken bonds and from fluid‐like collision cascade regions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Swift heavy-ion irradiation of amorphous materials causes nonsaturating plastic deformation. Thin samples deform anisotropically as if they were hammered. Thick samples or thin layers on top of thick crystalline substrates flow plastically during nonperpendicular irradiations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the constitutive equation of ion hammering not only describes the homogeneous flow of uniformly irradiated matter but also the deformation effects at boundaries between irradiated and unirradiated matter. An analytic expression is derived which describes the flow of thin surface layers in the vicinity of an abrupt boundary. This solution is complemented by finite-element calculations, which reveal the influence of finite transition widths. The constitutive equation is also solved numerically to unveil the boundary effects for thick samples, where the ion-induced deformation depends on the distance from the specimen surface. The calculations are compared with experiments carried out with thin amorphous silicon surface layers and thick crown glasses. The excellent agreement confirms the validity of the constitutive equation and supports its microscopic basis, namely the idea of an efficient relaxation of thermally induced shear stresses along the ion path during the thermal spike period.},

It is widely believed that the amorphous–liquid transition is a first-order melting transition. In contrast to this, recent computer simulations and the experimental observation of pressure-induced amorphization of nanoporous silicon have revived the idea of an underlying liquid–liquid phase transition implying the existence of a low-density liquid and its glass transition to the amorphous solid. Here we demonstrate that during irradiation with high-energy heavy ions amorphous silicon deforms plastically in the same way as conventional glasses. This behaviour provides experimental evidence for the existence of the low-density liquid. The glass transition temperature for a timescale of 10 picoseconds is estimated to be about 1,000 K. Our results support the idea of liquid polymorphism as a general phenomenon in tetrahedral networks.},

	abstract = {Ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si has attracted significant interest since the beginning of the use of ion implantation for the fabrication of Si devices. A number of theoretical calculations and experiments were designed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the crystal-to-amorphous transition in Si . Nowadays, a renewed interest in the modeling of amorphization mechanisms at atomic level has arisen due to the use of preamorphizing implants and high dopantimplantation doses for the fabrication of nanometric-scale Si devices. In this paper we will describe the most significant experimental observations related to the ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si and the models that have been developed to describe the process. Amorphous Si formation by ion implantation is the result of a critical balance between the damage generation and its annihilation. Implantation cascades generate different damage configurations going from isolated point defects and point defect clusters in essentially crystalline Si to amorphous pockets and continuous amorphous layers. The superlinear trend in the damage accumulation with dose and the existence of an ion mass depending critical temperature above which it is not possible to amorphize are some of the intriguing features of the ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si . Phenomenological models were developed in an attempt to explain the experimental observations, as well as other more recent atomistic models based on particular defects. Under traditional models, amorphization is envisaged to occur through the overlap of isolated damaged regions created by individual ions (heterogeneous amorphization) or via the buildup of simple defects (homogeneous amorphization). The development of atomistic amorphization models requires the identification of the lattice defects involved in the amorphization process and the characterization of their annealing behavior. Recently, the amorphization model based on the accumulation and interaction of bond defects or IV pairs has been shown to quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations. Current understanding of amorphous Si formation and its recrystallization, predictive capabilities of amorphization models, and residual damage after regrowth are analyzed.},

	abstract = {Track formation due to high electronic energy deposition during swift heavy ion irradiation is well known in insulating materials as well as in some intermetallic compounds and metals. In semiconductors the physical situation was much less clear, and only during the last few years several experimental results on the effect of high electronic energy deposition were published, which are summarised and discussed in the present paper. Like in insulators, swift heavy ion irradiation may cause amorphous tracks in some semiconductors, such as InP, InSb, InAs, GaSb and Ge, if a certain value of the electronic energy deposition E, per ion and unit length characteristic for the material and the ion is exceeded. The critical values of e, are much higher than in the other materials, and the corresponding ion energies are close to the maximum ion energies available with the existing high energy accelerators. On the other hand, with cluster ions, as e.g. C-60, tracks are easily formed in Si, Ge and GaAs with ion energies of several tens of MeV. Beside damage and track formation, annealing of damage was observed in the semiconductors, and it can be concluded that the effect of high electronic energy deposition represents itself as a competition between damage formation and annealing. Which of the two processes dominates is mainly determined by the electronic energy deposition. Qualitatively the observed behaviour can be explained in the framework of the thermal spike model. However, a quantitative description of all data available is not successful in the framework of this concept. This is obviously due to the fact that the effects are influenced not only by the electronic energy deposition, but also by a variety of other parameters, such as the ion velocity, the ion mass, the charge state of the impinging ions and the radial distribution of the electronic energy around the ions' path, All these parameters have to be taken into account within a theoretical description. However, the present situation is characterised by a lack of sufficient experimental data, and further systematic work is required to make progress in this interesting field. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Luminescent centres in diamond have recently emerged as a stable alternative, and, in the case of nitrogen-vacancy centres, offer spin quantum bits with optical readout. However, these luminescent centres in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling. Here, we demonstrate a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power. This result enables a new class of devices for photonic and quantum information processing based on nanostructured diamond, and could have a broader impact in nanoelectromechanical systems, sensing and scanning probe microscopy.},

	abstract = {This article provides a comprehensive review of current research activities that concentrate on one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures—wires, rods, belts, and tubes—whose lateral dimensions fall anywhere in the range of 1 to 100 nm. We devote the most attention to 1D nanostructures that have been synthesized in relatively copious quantities using chemical methods. We begin this article with an overview of synthetic strategies that have been exploited to achieve 1D growth. We then elaborate on these approaches in the following four sections: i) anisotropic growth dictated by the crystallographic structure of a solid material; ii) anisotropic growth confined and directed by various templates; iii) anisotropic growth kinetically controlled by supersaturation or through the use of an appropriate capping reagent; and iv) new concepts not yet fully demonstrated, but with long-term potential in generating 1D nanostructures. Following is a discussion of techniques for generating various types of important heterostructured nanowires. By the end of this article, we highlight a range of unique properties (e.g., thermal, mechanical, electronic, optoelectronic, optical, nonlinear optical, and field emission) associated with different types of 1D nanostructures. We also briefly discuss a number of methods potentially useful for assembling 1D nanostructures into functional devices based on crossbar junctions, and complex architectures such as 2D and 3D periodic lattices. We conclude this review with personal perspectives on the directions towards which future research on this new class of nanostructured materials might be directed.},

	abstract = {Nanostructured materials are today subject to intense research, as their mesoscopic properties will enable a variety of new applications in the future. They can be grown with specific properties under equilibrium conditions by a variety of different top-down and bottom-up synthesis techniques. Subsequent modification, including doping or alloying using the highly non-equilibrium process of ion irradiation, significantly expands the potpourri of functionality of what is today an important material class. Important and newly discovered effects must be considered compared to ion irradiation of bulk or thin film counterparts, as the ion range becomes comparable to the size of the nanotructure. Here, we will review recent high fluence irradiation studies reporting on non-linear incorporation of implanted species, enhanced sputtering yields, morphological changes induced by the high thermal impact, as well as strongly enhanced dynamic annealing for such confined nanostructures. Our review will also include the concurrent and recent progress in developing new simulation tools in order to describe and quantify those newly observed effects.},

After 16 MeV Auirradiation to a fluence of 11×10 14 cm −2 , a size aspect ratio of 5.0 was achieved. The size polydispersity (∼3\%) remains unaffected by the irradiation. The transverse diameter increases exponentially with ion fluence. By performing measurements as a function of ion energy at a fixed fluence, it is concluded that the transverse diameter increases linearly with the average electronic energy loss above a threshold value of ∼0.6 keV/nm. Nonellipsoidal colloids are observed in the case where the projected ion range is smaller than the colloid diameter.
