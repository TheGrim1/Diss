The closing rate, measured in situ, exhibited a memory effect: at the same instantaneous radius, pores that started larger close more slowly. An ion-stimulated viscous flow model is developed and solved in both a simple analytical approximation for the small-deformation limit and in a finite element solution for large deformations. The finite-element solution exhibits surprising changes in cross-section morphology, which may be extremely valuable for single biomolecule detection, and are untested experimentally. The finite-element solution reproduces the shape of the measured nanopore radius versus fluence behavior and the sign and magnitude of the measured memory effect. We discuss aspects of the experimental data not reproduced by the model, and successes and failures of the competing adatom diffusion model.},

We present an efficient molecular dynamics method for calculating ion ranges and deposited energies in the recoil energy region 100 eV to 100 keV. By taking into account only the interactions that are involved in the slowing-down process, range and deposited energy distributions at higher energies can be simulated. The method is demonstrated by range calculations of 40 keV H atoms in Si, 40 keV He atoms in Ta and 100 eV to 10 keV Si atoms in Si.},

	abstract = {We review the physical properties of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) of the type AII1−xMnxBVI (e.g., Cd1−xMnxSe, Hg1−xMnxTe). Crystallographic properties are discussed first, with emphasis on the common structural features which these materials have as a result of tetrahedral bonding. We then describe the band structure of the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys in the absence of an external magnetic field, stressing the close relationship of the sp electron bands in these materials to the band structure of the nonmagnetic AIIBVI ‘‘parent’’ semiconductors. In addition, the characteristics of the narrow (nearly localized) band arising from the half‐filled Mn 3d5 shells are described, along with their profound effect on the optical properties of DMS. We then describe our present understanding of the magnetic properties of the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys. In particular, we discuss the mechanism of the Mn++‐Mn++ exchange, which underlies the magnetism of these materials; we present an analytic formulation for the magnetic susceptibility of DMS in the paramagnetic range; we describe a somewhat empirical picture of the spin‐glasslike freezing in the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys, and its relationship to the short range antiferromagnetic order revealed by neutron scattering; and we point out some not yet fully understood questions concerning spin dynamics inDMS revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance. We then discuss the sp‐d exchange interaction between the sp band electrons of the AII1−xMnxBVI alloy and the 3d5 electrons associated with the Mn atoms. Here we present a general formulation of the exchange problem, followed by the most representative examples of its physical consequences, such as the giant Faraday rotation, the magnetic‐field‐induced metal‐to‐insulator transition in DMS, and the properties of the bound magnetic polaron. Next, we give considerable attention to the extremely exciting physics of quantum wells and superlattices involving DMS. We begin by describing the properties of the two‐dimensional gas existing at a DMS interface. We then briefly describe the current status of the AII1−xMnxBVI layers and superlattices (systems already successfully grown; methods of preparation; and basic nonmagnetic properties of the layered structures). We then describe new features observed in the magnetic behavior of the quasi‐two‐dimensional ultrathin DMS layers; and we discuss the exciting possibilities which the sp‐d exchange interaction offers in the quantum‐well situation. Finally, we list a number of topics which involve DMS but which have not been explicitly covered in this review such as elastic properties of DMS, DMS‐based devices, and the emerging work on diluted magnetic semiconductors other than the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys—and we provide relevant literature references to these omitted topics.},

The code simulates the transport of energetic ions through matter by means of a Monte Carlo algorithm, similar to the often-used TRIM code (Ziegler et al. (1985) [1]). New effects occur compared to bulk, when irradiating nanostructures, which are of the same size as the ion range or the damage cascade. To account for these effects, the target in our code does not consist of layers like in TRIM but can be defined as an arbitrary 3-dimensional structure. This allows to obtain more accurate 3D distributions of implanted ions and implantation damage for nanostructures, which cannot be described by a stack of layers. We demonstrate the functionality of the code by comparing simulations with ion beam implantation into nanowires.},

Next, we describe single-ion implantation as a tool for suppressing fluctuation in device function induced by the discrete number and random position of dopant atoms. Finally, we describe the common features associated with both 'probing' and 'modification' in terms of the nature and behaviour of defect clusters induced by single-ion irradiation.A special feature of the review is that the radiation effects discussed here are induced by 'single' particles, and not by particle beams. Although there is a great amount of accumulated data on radiation effects, they are discussed in the conventional terms of 'dose' or 'fluence,' whose unit is cm−2. Therefore, this review provides complementary information on radiation effects.},

The program is based on the well-known TRIDYN code which describes dynamic modifications along one dimension. In a computational volume composed of fixed and equisized voxels, local atomic density changes due to ion implantation or recoil relocation are relaxed to constant predefined atomic volumes. This is accomplished by interaction with neighboring voxels and by material transport towards and away from the surface. Arbitrary initial system shapes and elemental distributions can be defined as well as a wide range of irradiation conditions including non-uniform beam profiles. The paper addresses details of the involved algorithms and discusses potential artifacts with respect to surface sputtering, broadening of compositional profiles, and surface contours. It demonstrates the capabilities of the program by examples of focused ion beam erosion, self-organized surface pattering, and ion implantation and sputter-shaping of nanostructures.},

Using molecular dynamics simulation we study the sputtering of a Au nanofoam by 10 keV Au projectiles, and compare to the sputtering of a compact Au target. These bombardment conditions lead to a strong contribution of spikes to the sputtering process. We find the foam to sputter considerably less than the compact target; the open structure of the foam prevents the build-up of strong collision spike regions at the surface, which are the major source of sputtering in the compact target. Also emission takes a longer time scale in the foam, as particles need to travel longer pathways to be emitted. On the other hand, the molten phase is more extended in the foam and also exists for a longer time; this is caused by the reduced heat conductivity in this material.},

The nanowires with the lowest Mn concentration (similar to 0.0001\%) exhibit a low resistance of a few k Omega at 300 K and a 4\% positive MR at 1.6 K, which can be well described by invoking a spin-split subband model. In contrast, nanowires with the highest Mn concentration (4\%) display a large resistance of several M Omega at 300 K and a large negative MR of 85\% at 1.6 K. The large negative MR is interpreted in terms of spin-dependent hopping in a complex magnetic nanowire landscape of magnetic polarons, separated by intermediate regions of Mn impurity spins. Sweeping the magnetic field back and forth for the 4\% sample reveals a hysteresis that indicates the presence of a weak ferromagnetic phase. We propose co-doping with Zn to be a promising way to reach the goal of realizing ferromagnetic Ga1-xMnxAs nanowires for future nanospintronics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {Sputtering of a target by energetic ions or recoil atoms is assumed to result from cascades of atomic collisions. The sputtering yield is calculated under the assumption of random slowing down in an infinite medium. An integrodifferential equation for the yield is developed from the general Boltzmann transport equation. Input quantities are the cross sections for ion-target and target-target collisions, and atomic binding energies. Solutions of the integral equation are given that are asymptotically exact in the limit of high ion energy as compared to atomic binding energies. Two main stages of the collision cascade have to be distinguished: first, the slowing down of the primary ion and all recoiling atoms that have comparable energies—these particles determine the spatial extent of the cascade; second, the creation and slowing down of low-energy recoils that constitute the major part of all atoms set in motion. The separation between the two stages is essentially complete in the limit of high ion energy, as far as the calculation of the sputtering yield is concerned. High-energy collisions are characterized by Thomas-Fermi-type cross sections, while a Born-Mayer-type cross section is applied in the low-energy region. Electronic stopping is included when necessary. The separation of the cascade into two distinct stages has the consequence that two characteristic depths are important for the qualitative understanding of the sputtering process. First, the scattering events that eventually lead to sputtering take place within a certain layer near the surface, the thickness of which depends on ion mass and energy and on ion-target geometry. In the elastic collision region, this thickness is a sizable fraction of the ion range. Second, the majority of sputtered particles originate from a very thin surface layer (∼5 Å), because small energies dominate. The general sputtering-yield formula is applied to specific situations that are of interest for comparison with experiment. These include backsputtering of thick targets by ion beams at perpendicular and oblique incidence and ion energies above ∼100 eV, transmission sputtering of thin foils, sputtering by recoil atoms from α-active atoms distributed homogeneously or inhomogeneously in a thick target, sputtering of fissionable specimens by fission fragments, and sputtering of specimens that are irradiated in the core of a reactor or bombarded with a neutron beam. There is good agreement with experimental results on polycrystalline targets within the estimated accuracy of the data and the input parameters entering the theory. There is no need for adjustable parameters in the usual sense, but specific experimental setups are discussed that allow independent checks or accurate determination of some input quantities.},

	abstract = {The interaction of energetic ions with crystalline semiconductors may cause defect formation and amorphization both by nuclear and electronic energy deposition which occur simultaneously with different strength. In the energy range of dominating nuclear energy loss the transition to the amorphous state depends on the energy received by the target atoms through nuclear interactions, i.e. on ion mass and energy, and on the irradiation temperature which can favour dynamic defect annealing. Regarding the damage evolution, different groups of semiconductors are observed. In many materials (e.g. elemental and binary III–V semiconductors, SiC) a continuous increase of the damage concentration up to amorphization is found below characteristic critical irradiation temperatures. In some other materials (AlAs, GaN) the damage concentration increases stepwise until amorphorphization occurs, and in few other cases (ZnO, CdTe) amorphization is prevented even at 15 K. In case of swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation with dominating electronic energy loss, heavily damaged tracks are formed above critical values of the energy deposition in some materials (e.g. InP, InAs, InSb, GaSb), which may agglomerate to continuous amorphous layers. In other semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge, GaP, GaAs, AlAs) so far no track formation but only the formation of point defects and point defect complexes was observed. In the present contribution the state of the art of damage evolution and amorphization occurring at temperatures equal to and below room temperature in covalent and ionic-covalent semiconductors is summarized and possible mechanisms are discussed to understand the experimental results.},

	abstract = {Ionenstrahlimplantation ist eine nützliche und weit verbreitete Methode um Materialien zu dotieren. Nanostrukturen verhalten sich unter Ionenbestrahlung oft deutlich anders als das entsprechende Volumenmaterial; zum Beispiel unterscheiden sich die erzeugten Dotierprofile sowie die Erzeugung und das Ausheilen von Defekten. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird dieses Unterschiedliche Verhalten unter Ionenbestrahlung von drei Gesichtspunkten aus untersucht: Im ersten Teil wird ein neu entwickeltes Computerprogramm zur Simulation der Ionenbestrahlung von Nanostrukturen vorgestellt und diskutiert. Ähnlich wie bei vergleichbaren Programmen wird dabei ein Monte-Carlo-Algorithmus in Kombination mit der Zweierstoß-Näherung verwendet. Im Gegensatz zu konventionellen Programmen wird das Target aber durch kleine Zellen und nicht durch Schichten repräsentiert, so dass sich beliebige Nanostrukturen dreidimensional abbilden lassen. Die erzielten Simulationsergebnisse stimmen gut mit experimentellen Befunden überein. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wird die ionenstrahlinduzierte Verbiegung von Nanodrähten untersucht. Je nach Energie der Ionen lassen sich die Nanodrähte in verschiedene Richtungen verbiegen und ausrichten. Als zugrundeliegender Mechanismus wird die inhomogene Verteilung verschiedener ionenstrahlinduzierter Defekte identifiziert. Der dritte Teil beschäftigt sich mit der Dotierung von GaAs-Nanodrähten mittels Mangan. Wegen der geringen Löslichkeit der Übergangsmetalle in III-V-Halbleitern kann das Mangan nicht beim Wachstum der Nanodrähte eingebracht werden. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Mangan-Dotierung von GaAs mittels Ionenstrahlimplantation möglich ist. Dabei ist eine erhöhte Implantationstemperatur erforderlich, um das in Nanodrähten ohnehin verstärkte dynamische Ausheilen noch weiter zu unterstützen und die Kristallinität der Nanodrähte zu erhalten. Alle drei Teile zeigen deutliche Unterschiede bei der Ionenbestrahlung von Nanodrähten im Vergleich zum Volumenmaterial.},

A newly developed Monte-Carlo code SDTrimSP-2D simulates ion bombardment of surfaces with a 2D surface morphology (1D is depth and another dimension is lateral) defined by a vertical cross-section of the solid. The simulations allow to study numerically the interdependency of surface geometry and sputtering and implantation processes. Experimental results of the bombardment of W layers deposited on polished pyrolytic graphite with 6 keV C ions were used for comparison with results of the simulation. Free parameters of the code, particularly the so-called anisotropy coefficient, are calibrated by comparison of the macroscopic evolution of the elemental surface composition to the experimental results. After calibration, the code reproduces qualitatively the evolution of the shape of nano-scale surface structures observed by atomic force microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. The histograms of the surface heights obtained by measurements and by the simulation show qualitative agreement. Local values of the W sputtering yield and C areal density, which are accessible only from the simulations, have been found to be strongly dependent on the nano-scale geometry.},

	abstract = {Based on the sputtering version of the TRIM program for multicomponent targets, a Monte Carlo code has been developed which computes range profiles of implanted ions, composition profiles of the target and sputtering rates for a dynamically varying target composition. It takes into account compositional changes both due to the spatial distribution of target atoms deposited in collision cascades, and due to the presence of the implanted ions. The local density of the target is allowed to relax according to a given function of the densities of the individual components. The applications of the program cover a wide range of problems like the collisional atomic mixing of multilayered targets, dynamic implantation profiles at large fluences, and the fluence-dependent preferential sputtering of multicomponent materials. The present paper provides a description of the program and a critical comparison to similar Monte Carlo codes. As an application, the behaviour of the Ta-C system under He bombardment is studied with respect to sputtering yields, surface composition and composition profiles. Satisfactory agreement is obtained with experimental results given in the literature.},

We studied two approaches for the preparation of Mn-doped GaAs NWs: First, ion implantation at room temperature with subsequent annealing resulted in polycrystalline NWs and phase segregation of MnAs and GaAs. The second approach was ion implantation at elevated temperatures. In this case, the single-crystallinity of the GaAs NWs was maintained, and crystalline, highly Mn-doped GaAs NWs were obtained. The electrical resistance of such NWs dropped with increasing temperature (activation energy about 70 meV). Corresponding magnetoresistance measurements showed a decrease at low temperatures, indicating paramagnetism. Our findings suggest possibilities for future applications where dense arrays of GaMnAs nanowires may be used as a new kind of magnetic material system.},

The effect of crystalline structure on the results of Doppler-shift attenuation measurements [line shapes and F(τ) values] is calculated in various ways. Both range distributions and line shapes are found to be in agreement with experiment. Nuclear stopping during the slowing-down process in polycrystalline materials can be either smaller or larger than in amorphous materials. Some possible applications of the results are discussed.},

This is accomplished by interaction with neighboring voxels and by material transport towards and away from the surface. Arbitrary initial system shapes and elemental distributions can be defined as well as a wide range of irradiation conditions including non-uniform beam profiles. The paper addresses details of the involved algorithms and discusses potential artifacts with respect to surface sputtering, broadening of compositional profiles, and surface contours.

Zn(OAc)2 was found to strongly inhibit oxidation of Mn2+ by O2, allowing the synthesis of Mn2+:ZnO to be performed aerobically. Mn2+ ions were removed from the surfaces of as-prepared nanocrystals using dodecylamine to yield high-quality internally doped Mn2+:ZnO colloids of nearly spherical shape and uniform diameter (6.1 ± 0.7 nm). Simulations of the highly resolved X- and Q-band nanocrystal EPR spectra, combined with quantitative analysis of magnetic susceptibilities, confirmed that the manganese is substitutionally incorporated into the ZnO nanocrystals as Mn2+ with very homogeneous speciation, differing from bulk Mn2+:ZnO only in the magnitude of D-strain. Robust ferromagnetism was observed in spin-coated thin films of the nanocrystals, with 300 K saturation moments as large as 1.35 ?B/Mn2+ and TC {\textbackslash}textgreater 350 K. A distinct ferromagnetic resonance signal was observed in the EPR spectra of the ferromagnetic films.

The present empirical formula is found to be very useful for preliminary descriptions of the angular dependence of sputtering yield. This work was carried out under the collaborating Research Program at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Nagoya University. Lindhard's theory of the nuclear stopping power is developed to take into account the binding force between the lattice atoms of solids.

When a surface is bombarded at locally oblique incidence the most pronounced sputtering effect is likely to be observed not at the very point of impact, but further “downstream”. This effect may cause a significant reduction of the local sputtering yield on top of a spike or a ridge, and an increase on the bottom of a groove or a crater. As a consequence, small irregularities on a relatively smooth surface may be enhanced during bombardment. It is concluded that a microscopically flat surface is unstable under high-dose ion bombardment unless atom migration acts as a dominating smoothing effect. Conversely, sharp cones appear to be surprisingly stable under bombardment. Even on a clean surface, cones erode more slowly than a plane surface, provided that their dimensions are of the order of, or less than, the penetration depth of the ions.},

Irradiation-inducedanisotropicplastic deformation changes the colloid shape from spherical into oblate ellipsoidal at a rate that strongly increases with ion energy. At a fixed fluence, the transverse diameter increases with electronic energy loss. Even at an energy as low as 300 keV large particle anisotropy was found (size aspect ratio of 1.43 at 1×10 15 cm −2 ). The transverse plastic strain gradually decreases with increasing irradiation temperature: it decreases by a factor 4.5 between 85 and 380 K.

	abstract = {Spherical objects, such as clusters, nanoparticles, or aerosol particles, are sputtered when exposed to energetic irradiation. We use Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation to study this process, with 20 keV Ar impact on a-Si clusters as a prototypical example. The sputter yield is quantified as being influenced by oblique incidence and target curvature. Cluster radii R are scaled to the energy deposition depth, a. For large R (R/a{\textbackslash}textgreater5) sphere sputtering follows closely the sputtering of planar targets, if the variation of the incidence angle on the sphere surface is taken into account. For smaller radii, the yield increases due to the influence of curvature. For radii R/a≲1 pronounced forward sputtering leads to a maximum in the sputter yield. For smaller R, sputter emission becomes isotropic, but decreases in magnitude since not all the projectile energy is deposited in the sphere. However, for all spheres studied (R≥0.05a) the average sputter yield is larger than for infinitely large spheres (R→∞). A simple model based on linear collision cascade theory and assuming that the energy deposition profile is independent of the sphere size predicts sputtering for large spheres well, but fails for small spheres where it strongly underestimates sputtering. The MC data for the smaller spheres are supplemented by MD calculations, which indicate a significant additional contribution caused by spike sputtering.},

These measurements provide information about density changes and plastic phenomena in the implanted region. Experiments were performed for a variety of ions, a range of fluxes, and for temperatures between −175 and 200 °C. In all cases, the implanted region expanded due to the creation of damaged crystal, creating compressive stress in the implanted region on the order of 108 N/m2. Once heavily damaged or amorphous regions were formed, radiation‐enhanced plastic flow of material out of the plane of the wafer occurred in order to relieve the stress created by the expansion. The value of the shear viscosity responsible for this phenomena could be measured by comparing samples with the same history but different stresses. For 2‐MeV Xe implantation at room temperature and 1011 ions/cm2 s, the radiation‐enhanced shear viscosity is ∼ 1013 Ns/m2, which is at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the thermally activated shear viscosity. Possible contributions to flow from a homogeneous distribution of broken bonds and from fluid‐like collision cascade regions are discussed.},

Thick samples or thin layers on top of thick crystalline substrates flow plastically during nonperpendicular irradiations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the constitutive equation of ion hammering not only describes the homogeneous flow of uniformly irradiated matter but also the deformation effects at boundaries between irradiated and unirradiated matter. An analytic expression is derived which describes the flow of thin surface layers in the vicinity of an abrupt boundary. This solution is complemented by finite-element calculations, which reveal the influence of finite transition widths. The constitutive equation is also solved numerically to unveil the boundary effects for thick samples, where the ion-induced deformation depends on the distance from the specimen surface. The calculations are compared with experiments carried out with thin amorphous silicon surface layers and thick crown glasses. The excellent agreement confirms the validity of the constitutive equation and supports its microscopic basis, namely the idea of an efficient relaxation of thermally induced shear stresses along the ion path during the thermal spike period.},

By using simulations of full 400 eV-10 keV collision cascades and contrasting the results on different materials with each other, we probe the effect of the mass, melting temperature, material strength, and crystal structure on the modification of the material due to the cascade. The results show that the crystal structure has a strong effect on many aspects of damage production, while other material characteristics are of lesser overall importance. In all materials studied, isolated point defects produced by the cascade are predominantly interstitials. In semiconductors, amorphous clusters are produced in the cascade core, whereas in metals most of the crystal regenerates, leaving only small vacancy-rich clusters. Large interstitial clusters found in a few events in the heavy metals were observed to form by the isolation of a high-density liquid zone during the recrystallization phase of a cascade.},

It is widely believed that the amorphous–liquid transition is a first-order melting transition. In contrast to this, recent computer simulations and the experimental observation of pressure-induced amorphization of nanoporous silicon have revived the idea of an underlying liquid–liquid phase transition implying the existence of a low-density liquid and its glass transition to the amorphous solid. Here we demonstrate that during irradiation with high-energy heavy ions amorphous silicon deforms plastically in the same way as conventional glasses. This behaviour provides experimental evidence for the existence of the low-density liquid. The glass transition temperature for a timescale of 10 picoseconds is estimated to be about 1,000 K. Our results support the idea of liquid polymorphism as a general phenomenon in tetrahedral networks.},

	abstract = {Ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si has attracted significant interest since the beginning of the use of ion implantation for the fabrication of Si devices. A number of theoretical calculations and experiments were designed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the crystal-to-amorphous transition in Si . Nowadays, a renewed interest in the modeling of amorphization mechanisms at atomic level has arisen due to the use of preamorphizing implants and high dopantimplantation doses for the fabrication of nanometric-scale Si devices. In this paper we will describe the most significant experimental observations related to the ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si and the models that have been developed to describe the process. Amorphous Si formation by ion implantation is the result of a critical balance between the damage generation and its annihilation. Implantation cascades generate different damage configurations going from isolated point defects and point defect clusters in essentially crystalline Si to amorphous pockets and continuous amorphous layers. The superlinear trend in the damage accumulation with dose and the existence of an ion mass depending critical temperature above which it is not possible to amorphize are some of the intriguing features of the ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si . Phenomenological models were developed in an attempt to explain the experimental observations, as well as other more recent atomistic models based on particular defects. Under traditional models, amorphization is envisaged to occur through the overlap of isolated damaged regions created by individual ions (heterogeneous amorphization) or via the buildup of simple defects (homogeneous amorphization). The development of atomistic amorphization models requires the identification of the lattice defects involved in the amorphization process and the characterization of their annealing behavior. Recently, the amorphization model based on the accumulation and interaction of bond defects or IV pairs has been shown to quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations. Current understanding of amorphous Si formation and its recrystallization, predictive capabilities of amorphization models, and residual damage after regrowth are analyzed.},

	abstract = {Track formation due to high electronic energy deposition during swift heavy ion irradiation is well known in insulating materials as well as in some intermetallic compounds and metals. In semiconductors the physical situation was much less clear, and only during the last few years several experimental results on the effect of high electronic energy deposition were published, which are summarised and discussed in the present paper. Like in insulators, swift heavy ion irradiation may cause amorphous tracks in some semiconductors, such as InP, InSb, InAs, GaSb and Ge, if a certain value of the electronic energy deposition E, per ion and unit length characteristic for the material and the ion is exceeded. The critical values of e, are much higher than in the other materials, and the corresponding ion energies are close to the maximum ion energies available with the existing high energy accelerators. On the other hand, with cluster ions, as e.g. C-60, tracks are easily formed in Si, Ge and GaAs with ion energies of several tens of MeV. Beside damage and track formation, annealing of damage was observed in the semiconductors, and it can be concluded that the effect of high electronic energy deposition represents itself as a competition between damage formation and annealing. Which of the two processes dominates is mainly determined by the electronic energy deposition. Qualitatively the observed behaviour can be explained in the framework of the thermal spike model. However, a quantitative description of all data available is not successful in the framework of this concept. This is obviously due to the fact that the effects are influenced not only by the electronic energy deposition, but also by a variety of other parameters, such as the ion velocity, the ion mass, the charge state of the impinging ions and the radial distribution of the electronic energy around the ions' path, All these parameters have to be taken into account within a theoretical description. However, the present situation is characterised by a lack of sufficient experimental data, and further systematic work is required to make progress in this interesting field. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

For incidence angles close to the normal, we find that the ripple wave vector is parallel to the surface component of the beam direction, provided that longitudinal straggling of the beam is not too large. The ripple orientation is rotated by 90° when the beam is close to grazing incidence. The wavelength given by the theory varies as λ∼( f T)− 1 / 2 exp(−ΔE/2k B T) for high temperatures T and low fluxes f, where ΔE is the activation energy for surface self‐diffusion. The predicted magnitude of the wavelength is in reasonable accord with experiments in this regime.},

Devices based on fluorescent dye molecules, quantum dots and carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated, but none has combined a high single-photon flux with stable, room-temperature operation. Luminescent centres in diamond have recently emerged as a stable alternative, and, in the case of nitrogen-vacancy centres, offer spin quantum bits with optical readout. However, these luminescent centres in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling. Here, we demonstrate a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power. This result enables a new class of devices for photonic and quantum information processing based on nanostructured diamond, and could have a broader impact in nanoelectromechanical systems, sensing and scanning probe microscopy.},

For Pt particles with diameters 5–20 nm, the depth of the embedding increases with an ion dose until the particles are fully submerged at a dose of ∼10 16 cm −2 . The results are explained by capillary driving forces and an ion-induced viscousflow of amorphous SiO 2 . The irradiation-induced viscosity of SiO 2 needed to explain our results is ∼0.9×10 23 Pa ion cm −2 , consistent with previous measurements using stress relaxation. Similar results are obtained for 10 keV He + irradiation, suggesting that ion-induced viscosity arises from localized defects rather than from the creation of large melt zones.

We devote the most attention to 1D nanostructures that have been synthesized in relatively copious quantities using chemical methods. We begin this article with an overview of synthetic strategies that have been exploited to achieve 1D growth. We then elaborate on these approaches in the following four sections: i) anisotropic growth dictated by the crystallographic structure of a solid material; ii) anisotropic growth confined and directed by various templates; iii) anisotropic growth kinetically controlled by supersaturation or through the use of an appropriate capping reagent; and iv) new concepts not yet fully demonstrated, but with long-term potential in generating 1D nanostructures. Following is a discussion of techniques for generating various types of important heterostructured nanowires. By the end of this article, we highlight a range of unique properties (e.g., thermal, mechanical, electronic, optoelectronic, optical, nonlinear optical, and field emission) associated with different types of 1D nanostructures. We also briefly discuss a number of methods potentially useful for assembling 1D nanostructures into functional devices based on crossbar junctions, and complex architectures such as 2D and 3D periodic lattices. We conclude this review with personal perspectives on the directions towards which future research on this new class of nanostructured materials might be directed.},

	abstract = {A study is described of the dependence of the room-temperature production of divacancies and vacancies in silicon upon the energy of the bombarding electrons over the range 0.7-56 MeV. For the divacancy, the Si-G6 electron-paramagnetic-resonance spectrum associated with the singly positively charged state of the defect was monitored. As a monitor for single-vacancy production, the Si-B1 center due to the oxygen-vacancy pair was used. Over the energy range 0.7-1.5 MeV, the divacancy production rate rises a factor of 7 while the single-vacancy rate rises only a factor of 1.5, reflecting a higher threshold for divacancy production, as expected. Also presented are data on the dependence of the divacancy production rate on the orientation of the crystal axes with respect to the incident beam and on the resulting anisotropy of the divacancy orientation in the lattice. The results of the anisotropy studies are shown to be consistent with a simple microscopic model of the damage event.},

For H the electronic stopping power S is found to exhibit the expected velocity proportionality at low ion velocities, which confirms the anticipated excitation mechanisms responsible for the energy transfer between ions and the electrons in the solid. In contrast, for He, S shows a clear deviation from velocity proportionality for both materials at ion velocities below 0.8 atomic units, i.e., 64 keV. This result indicates a change in the interaction mechanisms active at the investigated ion velocities, which cannot exclusively be interpreted from the density of states of the target. Instead, the more complex electronic structure of the He ion enables an additional energy loss channel due to charge exchange by atomic level promotion. Associated energy losses together with a changed equilibrium charge state permit an explanation of the observed phenomenon.},

The sputter yield is increased for impact on convex surfaces. The influence of surface curvature along the incident-ion azimuth and perpendicular to it are discussed separately. Our analytical results are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for the specific case of 20 keV Ar ion impact on a cylindrical nanowire consisting of amorphous silicon.

With increasing temperature the growth rate decreases due to competing growth at the (1̄ 1̄ 1̄) substrate surface and at the \{1 1 0\} whisker side facets, which leads to significant tapering of the whiskers. For low temperatures, the growth rate R in the ln R=f(1/T)-plot results in an Arrhenius activation energy of about 67–75 kJ/mol, a value which is in agreement with activation energies reported for low-temperature planar growth of GaAs from TMG and AsH3. The Au acts as a local catalyst and as a collector of reactants, enabling a liquid-phase-epitaxy-like growth with high growth rates at the GaAs (1̄ 1̄ 1̄)B/(Au,Ga) interface.},

	abstract = {A review and expansion of the fundamental processes of the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth mechanism for nanowires is presented. Although the focus is on nanowires, most of the concepts may be applicable to whiskers, nanotubes, and other unidirectional growth. Important concepts in the VLS mechanism such as preferred deposition, supersaturation, and nucleation are examined. Nanowire growth is feasible using a wide range of apparatuses, material systems, and growth conditions. For nanowire growth the unidirectional growth rate must be much higher than growth rates of other surfaces and interfaces. It is concluded that a general, system independent mechanism should describe why nanowires grow faster than the surrounding surfaces. This mechanism is based on preferential nucleation at the interface between a mediating material called the collector and a crystalline solid. The growth conditions used mean the probability of nucleation is low on most of the surfaces and interfaces. Nucleation at the collector-crystal interface is however different and of special significance is the edge of the collector-crystal interface where all three phases meet. Differences in nucleation due to different crystallographic interfaces can occur even in two phase systems. We briefly describe how these differences in nucleation may account for nanowire growth without a collector. Identifying the mechanism of nanowire growth by naming the three phases involved began with the naming of the VLS mechanism. Unfortunately this trend does not emphasize the important concepts of the mechanism and is only relevant to one three phase system. We therefore suggest the generally applicable term preferential interface nucleation as a replacement for these different names focusing on a unifying mechanism in nanowire growth.},

The functional form is based on the bond-order scheme as devised by Abell-Tersoff and Brenner, while a systematic fitting scheme starting from the Pauling relation is used for determining all adjustable parameters. Reference data were taken from experiments if available, or computed by self-consistent total-energy calculations within the local density-functional theory otherwise. For fitting the parameters, only structural data of the metallic phases of gallium and arsenide as well as those of different GaAs phases were used. A number of tests on point defect properties, surface properties, and melting behavior have been performed afterward in order to validate the accuracy and transferability of the potential model, but were not part of the fitting procedure. While point defect properties and surfaces with low As content are found to be in good agreement with literature data, the description of As-rich surface reconstructions is not satisfactory. In the case of molten GaAs we find support for a structural model based on experiment that indicates a polymerized arsenic phase in the melt.},

	abstract = {In recent years many groups have advocated a thermal-spike model to explain a variety of experimental results in ion-irradiation of solids, as for example sputtering, mixing, compositional change, structural change, and track formation. The latter include crystal-to-amorphous transitions as well as track formation due to MeV/u particles. In this paper we reconsider the phenomena occurring during ion impact of solids looking at the time scale generally indicated as relevant for thermal-spike effects, namely a picosecond scale as shown by molecular dynamics. Sputtering, mixing, and track formation, however, will be analyzed in more detail. We consider first ion-beam sputtering and reiterate (as is already well-known) that yields which increase with the bulk temperature most often indicate merely the onset of normal vaporization. Indeed, only simulations appear to be capable of giving insight even if the information is sometimes tentative. In mixing, ballistic transport is important but not dominant. It is often argued that the additional transport is provided by thermal spikes but it is noted that such an assumption is normally not required by the experimental results. What is more relevant is a role for residual defects such that the total diffusion flux includes (if the defects are chemically guided) a modified Darken factor, or (if the defects are not chemically guided) simply an increased diffusivity. The time scale (min), distances (well beyond the collision cascade), temperature sensitivity (changes of as little as 75 K are relevant), and correlation with vacancy properties (thence with the solid rather than liquid state) which are relevant to these residual defects are not understandable in terms of thermal spikes. We finally consider track formation. Recent work claiming that track formation in solids, irradiated with heavy ions, may be understood in terms of thermal spikes is reconsidered to show that the thermal-spike model is utilized without considering all the relevant phenomena included in irradiation-induced heating and phase transitions. For example, a comparison of fs-laser pulse irradiation of Si with swift heavy-ion irradiation, shows that melting is possible in the first case since the excited electrons have a low and more or less restricted energy while in the case of swift ion-irradiation, the motion of the excited electrons includes a ballistic component which does not favour the localization of the thermal energy necessary to induce lattice melting. It is concluded that track formation is better understandable in a more general framework of defect-induced processes in solids.},

It combines mainly four features: (i) ion slowdown is computed separately from the main scattering/recoil event, which is directed towards the detector. (ii) A virtual detector, that is, a detector larger than the actual one can be used, followed by trajectory correction. (iii) For each collision during ion slowdown, scattering angle components are extracted form tables. (iv) Tables of scattering angle components, stopping power and energy straggling are indexed using the binary representation of floating point numbers, which allows logarithmic distribution of these tables without the computation of logarithms to access them. Tables are sufficiently fine-grained that interpolation is not necessary. Ion slowdown computation thus avoids trigonometric, inverse and transcendental function calls and, as much as possible, divisions. All these improvements make possible the computation of 107 collisions/s on current PCs. Results for transmitted ions of several masses in various substrates are well comparable to those obtained using SRIM-2006 in terms of both angular and energy distributions, as long as a sufficiently large number of collisions is considered for each ion. Examples of simulated spectrum show good agreement with experimental data, although a large detector rather than the virtual detector has to be used to properly simulate background signals that are due to plural collisions.

Results obtained combining Rutherford backscattering in channeling conditions, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques show that dual-beam irradiation of SiC induces a dramatic change in the final sample microstructure with a substantial decrease of radiation damage as compared to single-beam irradiation. Actually, a defective layer containing dislocations is formed upon dual-beam irradiation (S-n\&S-e), whereas single low-energy irradiation (S-n alone) or even sequential (S-n + S-e) irradiations lead to full amorphization. The healing process is ascribed to the electronic excitation arising from the electronic energy loss of swift ions. These results shed new light on the long-standing puzzling problem of the existence of a possible synergy between S-n and Se in ion-irradiation experiments. This work is interesting for both fundamental understanding of the ion-solid interactions and technological applications in the nuclear industry where recovery S-n/S-e effects may preserve the integrity of nuclear devices.

Molecular and chemical information is available in principle with, respectively, MeV-SIMS and high resolution PIXE. However, these techniques separately give only partial information - the secret of "Total IBA" is to find synergies between techniques used simultaneously which efficiently give extra information.

The accuracy of the calculated potentials is almost totally governed by the duality of the one-particle basis set.

Also multielement and multilayer targets, even complex geometries, can be treated exactly in order to simulate realistic cases. The present paper will concentrate mainly on sputtering calculations with the Monte Carlo code TRIM, which treats ion and recoil transport in amorphous matter. It is based — as are analytic theories and most other Monte Carlo codes — on binary collisions with target atoms initially at rest. Over the past few years, the basic physical input has been greatly improved. Both the interatomic potentials and the electronic stopping powers proved to be of crucial importance even for the lowest energies occurring in recoil cascades. With the Kr-C or universal potential and the recent ZBL electronic stopping, which includes the Z oscillations, and a planar surface binding energy set equal to the heat of sublimation, realistic sputtering predictions could be obtained for most metals — without the use of any adjustable parameters.},

We have calculated interatomic potentials from first principles in the free-electron approximation for 14 diatomic interactions representing light particles incident on heavy targets (M1≪M2), self-irradiation (M1=M2), and heavy particles on light targets (M1≫M2). The potentials were approximated by a Molière-like form and the parameters tabulated for general covenience. The classical orbit equation was integrated numerically for bare potentials and the scattering cross section, stopping power, range, and straggling calculated. Simple three-parameter expressions for the stopping power are given which are directly integrable to obtain the range. The results are in reasonable agreement with experiment for a representative Kr-C potential and agree within 10\% for an average potential derived from the free-electron calculations.},

We investigate the pattern formation on amorphous carbon thin films irradiated with Xe ions of energies between 200 eV and 10 keV. Sputter yield as well as number of displacements within the collision cascade vary strongly as function of ion energy and allow us to investigate the contributions of curvature-dependent erosion according to the Bradley-Harper model as well as mass redistribution according to the Carter-Vishnyakov model. We find parallel ripple orientations for an ion incidence angle of 60° and for all energies. A transition to perpendicular pattern orientation or a rather flat surface occurs around 80° for energies between 1 keV and 10 keV. Our results are compared with calculations based on both models. For the calculations we extract the shape and size of Sigmund's energy ellipsoid (parameters a, σ, μ), the angle-dependent sputter yield, and the mean mass redistribution distance from the Monte Carlo simulations with program SDTrimSP. The calculated curvature coefficients Sx and Sy describing the height evolution of the surface show that mass redistribution is dominant for parallel pattern formation in the whole energy regime. Furthermore, the angle where the parallel pattern orientation starts to disappear is related to curvature-dependent sputtering. In addition, we investigate the case of Pt erosion with 200 eV Ne ions, where mass redistribution vanishes. In this case, we observe perpendicular ripple orientation in accordance with curvature-dependent sputtering and the predictions of the Bradley-Harper model.},

The energy of impact is changed from 2 keV to 10 keV and the incidence angle of bombardment is modified from 30° to 60°. Emitted matter is collected on a semi-cylindrical copper foil. Subsequently, spatially resolved thicknesses and elemental compositions of the deposit are determined by means of SIMS depth profiles. These distributions across the deposit allow us to deduce the angular distribution of emitted matter. Our experimental data show that the preferential direction as well as the spreading around this direction can be altered, with more or less efficiency, by the variation of the bombardment parameters. For the indium phosphide, we also study the elemental composition of the deposit in function of the emission angle. It shows an increasing deviation from stoichiometry with increasing emission angle.},

The diameter dependence of the sputtering shows a maximum if the ion range matches the nanowire diameter, which is in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations based on binary collisions. Nanowires irradiated at room temperature, however, amorphize and deform plastically. So far, plastic deformation has not been observed in bulk silicon at such low ion energies. The magnitude and direction of the deformation is independent of the ion-beam direction and cannot be explained with mass-transport in a binary collision cascade but only by collective movement of atoms in the collision cascade with the given boundary conditions of a high surface to volume ratio.},

	abstract = {Ion beam irradiation is-a potential tool for phase formation and material modification as a non-equilibrium technique. Localized rise in temperature and ultra fast (similar to 10(-12) s) dissipations of impinging energy make it an attractive tool for metastable phase formation. As a matter of fact, a major component of materials science is dominated by ion beam methods, either for synthesis of materials or for its characterization. The synthesis of nanostructures, and their modification by ion beam technique will be discussed in this review article. Formation of nanostructures using ion beam technique will be discussed first. Depending on species (e.g., mass and charge state) and energy range, there are various modes for an energetic ion to dissipate its energy. The role of the electron will also be covered in this article as a basic principle of its interaction with matter, which is same as for an ion. By using a simple reactive ion beam or electron induced deposition, a secondary phase can be nucleated by ion beam mixing techniques, either by using inert gas irradiation or reactive gas implantation on any desired substrate. Nucleation of secondary phase can also be executed by electron irradiation and direct implantation of either negative or positive ions. Post implantation annealing processes are required for the complete growth of clusters formed in most of these ion irradiation techniques. Implantation processes being inherently a non-equilibrium technique, defects always have a role to play in phase formation, amorphization, and beyond (blister formation). When implanted with large energy, even electrons, one of the lightest charged particles, also manifest these properties. Electronic and nuclear energy losses of the impinging charged particle play a crucial role in material modification. Doping a nanocluster, however, is still a controversial topic. Some light will be shed on this topic with a discussion of focused ion beam.},

High-density (10 μm−2) nanowire arrays can be grown on sapphire substrates with or without gold catalysts. However, if a ZnO wetting layer was adopted, the density of ZnO nanowires could be controlled with high reproducibility. The decreasing growth density is attributed to a competition between the two-dimensional film epitaxy and one-dimensional nanowire growth. The dependence of nanowire density on the substrate–target distance mainly arises from the expansion dynamics of the plasma plume and the chamber geometry. Using low-density nanowires as templates, a general PLD route was developed to grow radial nanowire heterostructures. Here we demonstrate MgZnO/ZnO/MgZnO nanowire quantum wells and ZnO/ZnO:P core–shell nanowire p–n junctions.},

Photoluminescence measurements demonstrate the optical activation of trivalent RE-elements and the emission of the characteristic intra-4f-luminescence of the respective RE atoms, which could be assigned according to the Dieke-diagram.

	abstract = {This work addresses composition profiles and partial sputter yields of an alloy under ion bombardment. The effects of preferential sputtering, mixing, and Gibbsian segregation have been modelled. The theoretical basis is an integro-differential equation derived previously, into which a feasible expression for a segregation current has been included. A dependence on composition of pertinent input parameters like relocation cross sections and atomic volumes has been allowed for but has not been explored explicitly. In the limit of high fluence, a stationary state may be reached with a composition profile that shows more or less pronounced deviations from bulk stoichiometry. Two methods have been designed for direct determination of such stationary solutions. An iterative scheme for numerical solution of the nonlinear balance equation is very efficient and accurate. An approximate scheme, assuming weakly preferential behavior and thus based on a linearized balance equation, turns out to be quite accurate even in case of strongly preferential sputtering. An explicit analytical solution is given for a particular example. On the basis of simple, schematic input, it is seen that the deviation of a stationary composition profile from bulk stoichiometry may be very strong, even when the sputter cross section is only weakly or moderately preferential. This difference is most pronounced in the absence of substantial feeding by mixing and segregation. In case of a nonzero depth of origin of sputtered atoms, composition profiles depend sensitively on the depth dependence of the sputter cross section, even in cases where consideration of only the partial sputter yields would suggest stoichiometric sputtering. A few examples illustrate explicitly the competition between preferential sputtering on the one hand and mixing or segregation on the other.},

	abstract = {Ionoluminescence (IL) is the emission of light from a material due to excitation by an ion beam. In this work, a helium ion microscope (HIM) has been used in conjunction with a luminescence detection system to characterize IL from materials in an analogous way to how cathodoluminescence (CL) is characterized in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). A survey of the helium ion beam induced IL characteristics, including images and spectra, of a variety of materials known to exhibit CL in an SEM is presented. Direct band-gap semiconductors that luminesce strongly in the SEM are found not do so in the HIM, possibly due to defect-related nonradiative pathways created by the ion beam. Other materials do, however, exhibit IL, including a cerium-doped garnet sample, quantum dots, and rare-earth doped LaPO4 nanocrystals. These emissions are a result of transitions between f electron states or transitions across size dependent band gaps. In all these samples, IL is found to decay with exposure to the beam, fitting well to double exponential functions. In an exploration of the potential of this technique for biological tagging applications, imaging with the IL emitted by rare-earth doped LaPO4 nanocrystals, simultaneously with secondary electron imaging, is demonstrated at a range of magnifications.},

The transient thermal calculation is restricted to the amorphous materials a-Ge, a-Si, and a-Fe85B15, for which nearly all latent-track radii and/or macroscopic thermodynamic properties are known. The heat-flow equation is solved numerically in cylindrical geometry. The time-dependent heat-generation term is assumed to be due to the electron-atom interaction. The characteristic length λ of the energy transport by secondary electrons is taken as the only free parameter and the maximum diameter of the cylinder of liquid matter is considered as the diameter of the observed latent track. Using the single value λ=14 nm, we have been able to calculate these diameters in a-Si and a-Ge in reasonable agreement with experimental track diameters, taking into account the large differences between the macroscopic thermodynamic parameters of both materials. This λ value is less than that for the crystalline state. In the case of a-Fe85B15, the diameters calculated with use of λ=19 nm are in agreement with the ones determined recently by electrical-resistivity change.},

Here we report the assembly of functional nanoscale devices from indium phosphide nanowires, the electrical properties of which are controlled by selective doping. Gate-voltage-dependent transport measurements demonstrate that the nanowires can be predictably synthesized as either n- or p-type. These doped nanowires function as nanoscale field-effect transistors, and can be assembled into crossed-wire p-n junctions that exhibit rectifying behaviour. Significantly, the p-n junctions emit light strongly and are perhaps the smallest light-emitting diodes that have yet been made. Finally, we show that electric-field-directed assembly can be used to create highly integrated device arrays from nanowire building blocks.},

Numerical modeling was used to study coupling between a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) color center and optical modes of a nanowire, and to find an optimal range of nanowire diameters that allows for large collection efficiency of emitted photons. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactive ion etching (RIE) with oxygen is used to fabricate the nanowires. Drop-casted nanoparticles (including Au, SiO2 and Al2O3) as well as electron beans lithography defined spin-on glass and evaporated Au have been used as an etch mask. We found Al2O3 nanoparticles to be the most etch resistant.

The surface of the specimen to be analysed is sputtered by means of an ion beam. The particles emitted under the impact of these primary ions are deposited at a sub-monolayer level on a dedicated collector under UHV conditions. It is only in a second step that the deposited matter is analysed in analytical instruments (mainly dynamic and static SIMS). Depositing the matter sputtered from different samples or from different layers of a sample on a same collector makes Storing Matter a powerful tool to circumvent the well-known matrix effect in SIMS. Moreover, enhanced secondary ion emission can be obtained in the different SIMS analysis modes as the collector surface and thus the matrix is chosen with respect to the elements to be analysed and the analysis mode (M+, M−, cationisation for organic information, …). In order to allow the different steps of the Storing Matter technique to be performed under optimised conditions, a dedicated prototype instrument has been developed at SAM. This paper will provide an introduction to the Storing Matter technique and a description of the prototype.},

(2) Energy transfer from the substrate to surface atoms would be expected to cause an enrichment in the less abundant component. (3) Effects relating to surface binding energies are most easily analyzed for alloys, the prediction being here that a target is enriched in the less volatile component. Finally, (4) effects leading to vapor pressures are considered. The actual responses of a rather large number of binary oxide and alloy targets are most simply summarized by noting the following: (a) CdO preferentially loses. O whereas ZnO does not; (b) both Al0.33 Au0.67 Au0.33 preferentially lose Al. As such we conclude that preferential sputtering with oxides is understandable in terms of vapor-pressure effects, though surface binding energies in principle also play a role.

As pure graphite shows regimes of enhanced erosion at elevated temperatures, other low-Z materials, such as Be, B and their compounds and carbides are examined, as well as graphite doped with various elements. However, high-Z materials show a high threshold energy for light ion sputtering and have been proposed as divertor material for the case of a high density, low temperature divertor plasma. Starting from a short introduction into the sputtering mechanism the dependence of sputtering yield, threshold energy and yield enhancement at grazing incidence on target mass is discussed for deuterium ion and self sputtering. The theoretical expectations are compared to experimental results as well as results from computer simulations. The dependence on surface topography is demonstrated both for normal and for oblique angle of incidence. For compounds the special problem is the change of surface composition, either by preferential sputtering of one compound or by implantation and accumulation of ions such as carbon or oxygen. These changes may significantly alter the thermophysical properties of the surface layers. The temperature dependence of the erosion yield is compared for different materials including chemical effects, radiation enhanced and thermal sublimation. With these results the materials are compared concerning their net erosion/deposition at divertor plates, their figure of merit, which relates the maximum tolerable impurity concentration to the sputtering yield, and, finally, concerning their surface temperature limits where run-away self sputtering occurs.},

	abstract = {Space weathering processes that operate in the lunar regolith modify the surfaces of lunar soil gains. Transmission electron microscope analysis of the lunar soil grains from the fine size fraction of several lunar soils show that most grains are surrounded by thin (60-200 nm thick) rims. The microstructure and chemical compositions of the rims can be used to classify rims into four broad categories: amorphous, inclusion-rich, multiple, and vesicular. Amorphous rims are noncrystalline, generally lack crystalline inclusions, show evidence for preferential sputtering of cations, and are produced largely by solar-wind irradiation damage. Inclusion-rich rims contain abundant nanometer-sized grains of Fe metal as randomly dispersed inclusions or as distinct layers embedded in an amorphous silica-rich matrix. Inclusion-rich rims are compositionally distinct from their host grains and typically contain accumulations of elements that are not indigenous to the host. Inclusion-rich rims are formed largely by the deposition of impact-generated vapors with a contribution from the deposition of sputtered ions. A continuum in the chemical and microstructural properties exists between typical amorphous rims and typical inclusion-rich rims. Multiple-rims consist of a distinct radiation-damaged layer up to 50 nm thick, that is overlain by vapor-deposited material of comparable thickness. Vesicular rims are compositionally similar to their hosts and are characterized by an abundance of small ({\textbackslash}textless50 nm in diameter) vesicles concentrated in the outer 100 nm of the rims. The formation of vesicular rims is apparently due to the evolution of solar-wind implanted gases in response to a pulse-heating event. The formation of rims on lunar soils is complex and involves several processes whose effects may be superimposed. From this study, it is shown that one process does not dominate and that the relative importance of vapor-deposition is comparable to radiation-damage in the formation of rims on lunar silicate grains. The presence of rims on lunar soil grains, particularly those with nanometer-sized Fe metal inclusions, may have a major influence on the optical and magnetic properties of lunar soils.

This value is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the same irradiation of flat Au surfaces. Using MD simulations, we show that the very high yield can be understood as a combination of enhanced yields due to low incoming angles at the sides of the nanowire, as well as the high surface-to-volume ratio causing enhanced explosive sputtering from heat spikes. We also find, both in experiments and simulations, that channeling has a strong effect on the sputtering yield: if the incoming beam happens to be aligned with a crystal axis of the nanorod, the yield can decrease to about 100.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to develop and process a microelectrode integrated in a standard AFM tip. The presented fabrication process allows the integration of an electroactive area at an exactly defined distance above of the end of a scanning probe tip and the subsequent remodeling and sharpening of the original AFM tip using a focused ion beam (FIB) technique (See ref 1 for patent information). Thus, the functionality of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) can be integrated into any standard atomic force microscope (AFM). With the demonstrated approach, a precisely defined and constant distance between the microelectrode and the sample surface can be obtained, alternatively to the indirect determination of this distance usually applied in SECM experiments. Hence, a complete separation of the topographical information and the electrochemical signal is possible. The presented technique is a significant step toward electrochemical imaging with submicrometer electrodes as demonstrated by the development of the first integrated frame submicroelectrode.},

	abstract = {Now in a new full-color edition, Fundamentals of Photonics, Second Edition is a self-contained and up-to-date introductory-level textbook that thoroughly surveys this rapidly expanding area of engineering and applied physics. Featuring a logical blend of theory and applications, coverage includes detailed accounts of the primary theories of light, including ray optics, wave optics, electromagnetic optics, and photon optics, as well as the interaction of photons and atoms, and semiconductor optics. Presented at increasing levels of complexity, preliminary sections build toward more advanced topics, such as Fourier optics and holography, guided-wave and fiber optics, semiconductor sources and detectors, electro-optic and acousto-optic devices, nonlinear optical devices, optical interconnects and switches, and optical fiber communications. Each of the twenty-two chapters of the first edition has been thoroughly updated. The Second Edition also features entirely new chapters on photonic-crystal optics (including multilayer and periodic media, waveguides, holey fibers, and resonators) and ultrafast optics (including femtosecond optical pulses, ultrafast nonlinear optics, and optical solitons). The chapters on optical interconnects and switches and optical fiber communications have been completely rewritten to accommodate current technology. Each chapter contains summaries, highlighted equations, exercises, problems, and selected reading lists. Examples of real systems are included to emphasize the concepts governing applications of current interest.},
