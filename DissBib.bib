	abstract = {Binary collision approximation methods have been conventionally used to describe the slowing down of recoiling ions. In order to better understand the slowing-down process, molecular dynamics methods are more and more used in the literature. However, the computer capacity limits the usefulness of the methods in most practical cases where ion implantation in the 1–100 keV energy range is used. We present an efficient molecular dynamics method for calculating ion ranges and deposited energies in the recoil energy region 100 eV to 100 keV. By taking into account only the interactions that are involved in the slowing-down process, range and deposited energy distributions at higher energies can be simulated. The method is demonstrated by range calculations of 40 keV H atoms in Si, 40 keV He atoms in Ta and 100 eV to 10 keV Si atoms in Si.},

	abstract = {We review the physical properties of diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) of the type AII1−xMnxBVI (e.g., Cd1−xMnxSe, Hg1−xMnxTe). Crystallographic properties are discussed first, with emphasis on the common structural features which these materials have as a result of tetrahedral bonding. We then describe the band structure of the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys in the absence of an external magnetic field, stressing the close relationship of the sp electron bands in these materials to the band structure of the nonmagnetic AIIBVI ‘‘parent’’ semiconductors. In addition, the characteristics of the narrow (nearly localized) band arising from the half‐filled Mn 3d5 shells are described, along with their profound effect on the optical properties of DMS. We then describe our present understanding of the magnetic properties of the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys. In particular, we discuss the mechanism of the Mn++‐Mn++ exchange, which underlies the magnetism of these materials; we present an analytic formulation for the magnetic susceptibility of DMS in the paramagnetic range; we describe a somewhat empirical picture of the spin‐glasslike freezing in the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys, and its relationship to the short range antiferromagnetic order revealed by neutron scattering; and we point out some not yet fully understood questions concerning spin dynamics inDMS revealed by electron paramagnetic resonance. We then discuss the sp‐d exchange interaction between the sp band electrons of the AII1−xMnxBVI alloy and the 3d5 electrons associated with the Mn atoms. Here we present a general formulation of the exchange problem, followed by the most representative examples of its physical consequences, such as the giant Faraday rotation, the magnetic‐field‐induced metal‐to‐insulator transition in DMS, and the properties of the bound magnetic polaron. Next, we give considerable attention to the extremely exciting physics of quantum wells and superlattices involving DMS. We begin by describing the properties of the two‐dimensional gas existing at a DMS interface. We then briefly describe the current status of the AII1−xMnxBVI layers and superlattices (systems already successfully grown; methods of preparation; and basic nonmagnetic properties of the layered structures). We then describe new features observed in the magnetic behavior of the quasi‐two‐dimensional ultrathin DMS layers; and we discuss the exciting possibilities which the sp‐d exchange interaction offers in the quantum‐well situation. Finally, we list a number of topics which involve DMS but which have not been explicitly covered in this review such as elastic properties of DMS, DMS‐based devices, and the emerging work on diluted magnetic semiconductors other than the AII1−xMnxBVI alloys—and we provide relevant literature references to these omitted topics.},

The code simulates the transport of energetic ions through matter by means of a Monte Carlo algorithm, similar to the often-used TRIM code (Ziegler et al. (1985) [1]). New effects occur compared to bulk, when irradiating nanostructures, which are of the same size as the ion range or the damage cascade. To account for these effects, the target in our code does not consist of layers like in TRIM but can be defined as an arbitrary 3-dimensional structure. This allows to obtain more accurate 3D distributions of implanted ions and implantation damage for nanostructures, which cannot be described by a stack of layers. We demonstrate the functionality of the code by comparing simulations with ion beam implantation into nanowires.},

Next, we describe single-ion implantation as a tool for suppressing fluctuation in device function induced by the discrete number and random position of dopant atoms. Finally, we describe the common features associated with both 'probing' and 'modification' in terms of the nature and behaviour of defect clusters induced by single-ion irradiation.A special feature of the review is that the radiation effects discussed here are induced by 'single' particles, and not by particle beams. Although there is a great amount of accumulated data on radiation effects, they are discussed in the conventional terms of 'dose' or 'fluence,' whose unit is cm−2. Therefore, this review provides complementary information on radiation effects.},

The program is based on the well-known TRIDYN code which describes dynamic modifications along one dimension. In a computational volume composed of fixed and equisized voxels, local atomic density changes due to ion implantation or recoil relocation are relaxed to constant predefined atomic volumes. This is accomplished by interaction with neighboring voxels and by material transport towards and away from the surface. Arbitrary initial system shapes and elemental distributions can be defined as well as a wide range of irradiation conditions including non-uniform beam profiles. The paper addresses details of the involved algorithms and discusses potential artifacts with respect to surface sputtering, broadening of compositional profiles, and surface contours. It demonstrates the capabilities of the program by examples of focused ion beam erosion, self-organized surface pattering, and ion implantation and sputter-shaping of nanostructures.},

Using molecular dynamics simulation we study the sputtering of a Au nanofoam by 10 keV Au projectiles, and compare to the sputtering of a compact Au target. These bombardment conditions lead to a strong contribution of spikes to the sputtering process. We find the foam to sputter considerably less than the compact target; the open structure of the foam prevents the build-up of strong collision spike regions at the surface, which are the major source of sputtering in the compact target. Also emission takes a longer time scale in the foam, as particles need to travel longer pathways to be emitted. On the other hand, the molten phase is more extended in the foam and also exists for a longer time; this is caused by the reduced heat conductivity in this material.},

The nanowires with the lowest Mn concentration (similar to 0.0001\%) exhibit a low resistance of a few k Omega at 300 K and a 4\% positive MR at 1.6 K, which can be well described by invoking a spin-split subband model. In contrast, nanowires with the highest Mn concentration (4\%) display a large resistance of several M Omega at 300 K and a large negative MR of 85\% at 1.6 K. The large negative MR is interpreted in terms of spin-dependent hopping in a complex magnetic nanowire landscape of magnetic polarons, separated by intermediate regions of Mn impurity spins. Sweeping the magnetic field back and forth for the 4\% sample reveals a hysteresis that indicates the presence of a weak ferromagnetic phase. We propose co-doping with Zn to be a promising way to reach the goal of realizing ferromagnetic Ga1-xMnxAs nanowires for future nanospintronics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

	abstract = {Sputtering of a target by energetic ions or recoil atoms is assumed to result from cascades of atomic collisions. The sputtering yield is calculated under the assumption of random slowing down in an infinite medium. An integrodifferential equation for the yield is developed from the general Boltzmann transport equation. Input quantities are the cross sections for ion-target and target-target collisions, and atomic binding energies. Solutions of the integral equation are given that are asymptotically exact in the limit of high ion energy as compared to atomic binding energies. Two main stages of the collision cascade have to be distinguished: first, the slowing down of the primary ion and all recoiling atoms that have comparable energies—these particles determine the spatial extent of the cascade; second, the creation and slowing down of low-energy recoils that constitute the major part of all atoms set in motion. The separation between the two stages is essentially complete in the limit of high ion energy, as far as the calculation of the sputtering yield is concerned. High-energy collisions are characterized by Thomas-Fermi-type cross sections, while a Born-Mayer-type cross section is applied in the low-energy region. Electronic stopping is included when necessary. The separation of the cascade into two distinct stages has the consequence that two characteristic depths are important for the qualitative understanding of the sputtering process. First, the scattering events that eventually lead to sputtering take place within a certain layer near the surface, the thickness of which depends on ion mass and energy and on ion-target geometry. In the elastic collision region, this thickness is a sizable fraction of the ion range. Second, the majority of sputtered particles originate from a very thin surface layer (∼5 Å), because small energies dominate. The general sputtering-yield formula is applied to specific situations that are of interest for comparison with experiment. These include backsputtering of thick targets by ion beams at perpendicular and oblique incidence and ion energies above ∼100 eV, transmission sputtering of thin foils, sputtering by recoil atoms from α-active atoms distributed homogeneously or inhomogeneously in a thick target, sputtering of fissionable specimens by fission fragments, and sputtering of specimens that are irradiated in the core of a reactor or bombarded with a neutron beam. There is good agreement with experimental results on polycrystalline targets within the estimated accuracy of the data and the input parameters entering the theory. There is no need for adjustable parameters in the usual sense, but specific experimental setups are discussed that allow independent checks or accurate determination of some input quantities.},

	abstract = {The interaction of energetic ions with crystalline semiconductors may cause defect formation and amorphization both by nuclear and electronic energy deposition which occur simultaneously with different strength.

In the energy range of dominating nuclear energy loss the transition to the amorphous state depends on the energy received by the target atoms through nuclear interactions, i.e. on ion mass and energy, and on the irradiation temperature which can favour dynamic defect annealing. Regarding the damage evolution, different groups of semiconductors are observed. In many materials (e.g. elemental and binary III–V semiconductors, SiC) a continuous increase of the damage concentration up to amorphization is found below characteristic critical irradiation temperatures. In some other materials (AlAs, GaN) the damage concentration increases stepwise until amorphorphization occurs, and in few other cases (ZnO, CdTe) amorphization is prevented even at 15 K.

In case of swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation with dominating electronic energy loss, heavily damaged tracks are formed above critical values of the energy deposition in some materials (e.g. InP, InAs, InSb, GaSb), which may agglomerate to continuous amorphous layers. In other semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge, GaP, GaAs, AlAs) so far no track formation but only the formation of point defects and point defect complexes was observed.

In the present contribution the state of the art of damage evolution and amorphization occurring at temperatures equal to and below room temperature in covalent and ionic-covalent semiconductors is summarized and possible mechanisms are discussed to understand the experimental results.},

	abstract = {Ionenstrahlimplantation ist eine nützliche und weit verbreitete Methode um Materialien zu dotieren. Nanostrukturen verhalten sich unter Ionenbestrahlung oft deutlich anders als das entsprechende Volumenmaterial; zum Beispiel unterscheiden sich die erzeugten Dotierprofile sowie die Erzeugung und das Ausheilen von Defekten. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird dieses Unterschiedliche Verhalten unter Ionenbestrahlung von drei Gesichtspunkten aus untersucht:
Im ersten Teil wird ein neu entwickeltes Computerprogramm zur Simulation der Ionenbestrahlung von Nanostrukturen vorgestellt und diskutiert. Ähnlich wie bei vergleichbaren Programmen wird dabei ein Monte-Carlo-Algorithmus in Kombination mit der Zweierstoß-Näherung verwendet. Im Gegensatz zu konventionellen Programmen wird das Target aber durch kleine Zellen und nicht durch Schichten repräsentiert, so dass sich beliebige Nanostrukturen dreidimensional abbilden lassen. Die erzielten Simulationsergebnisse stimmen gut mit experimentellen Befunden überein.
Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit wird die ionenstrahlinduzierte Verbiegung von Nanodrähten untersucht. Je nach Energie der Ionen lassen sich die Nanodrähte in verschiedene Richtungen verbiegen und ausrichten. Als zugrundeliegender Mechanismus wird die inhomogene Verteilung verschiedener ionenstrahlinduzierter Defekte identifiziert.
Der dritte Teil beschäftigt sich mit der Dotierung von GaAs-Nanodrähten mittels Mangan. Wegen der geringen Löslichkeit der Übergangsmetalle in III-V-Halbleitern kann das Mangan nicht beim Wachstum der Nanodrähte eingebracht werden. Es wird gezeigt, dass die Mangan-Dotierung von GaAs mittels Ionenstrahlimplantation möglich ist. Dabei ist eine erhöhte Implantationstemperatur erforderlich, um das in Nanodrähten ohnehin verstärkte dynamische Ausheilen noch weiter zu unterstützen und die Kristallinität der Nanodrähte zu erhalten. Alle drei Teile zeigen deutliche Unterschiede bei der Ionenbestrahlung von Nanodrähten im Vergleich zum Volumenmaterial.},

The simulations allow to study numerically the interdependency of surface geometry and sputtering and implantation processes. Experimental results of the bombardment of W layers deposited on polished pyrolytic graphite with 6 keV C ions were used for comparison with results of the simulation. Free parameters of the code, particularly the so-called anisotropy coefficient, are calibrated by comparison of the macroscopic evolution of the elemental surface composition to the experimental results. After calibration, the code reproduces qualitatively the evolution of the shape of nano-scale surface structures observed by atomic force microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. The histograms of the surface heights obtained by measurements and by the simulation show qualitative agreement. Local values of the W sputtering yield and C areal density, which are accessible only from the simulations, have been found to be strongly dependent on the nano-scale geometry.},

	abstract = {Based on the sputtering version of the TRIM program for multicomponent targets, a Monte Carlo code has been developed which computes range profiles of implanted ions, composition profiles of the target and sputtering rates for a dynamically varying target composition. It takes into account compositional changes both due to the spatial distribution of target atoms deposited in collision cascades, and due to the presence of the implanted ions. The local density of the target is allowed to relax according to a given function of the densities of the individual components. The applications of the program cover a wide range of problems like the collisional atomic mixing of multilayered targets, dynamic implantation profiles at large fluences, and the fluence-dependent preferential sputtering of multicomponent materials. The present paper provides a description of the program and a critical comparison to similar Monte Carlo codes. As an application, the behaviour of the Ta-C system under He bombardment is studied with respect to sputtering yields, surface composition and composition profiles. Satisfactory agreement is obtained with experimental results given in the literature.},

We studied two approaches for the preparation of Mn-doped GaAs NWs: First, ion implantation at room temperature with subsequent annealing resulted in polycrystalline NWs and phase segregation of MnAs and GaAs. The second approach was ion implantation at elevated temperatures. In this case, the single-crystallinity of the GaAs NWs was maintained, and crystalline, highly Mn-doped GaAs NWs were obtained. The electrical resistance of such NWs dropped with increasing temperature (activation energy about 70 meV). Corresponding magnetoresistance measurements showed a decrease at low temperatures, indicating paramagnetism. Our findings suggest possibilities for future applications where dense arrays of GaMnAs nanowires may be used as a new kind of magnetic material system.},

This is accomplished by interaction with neighboring voxels and by material transport towards and away from the surface. Arbitrary initial system shapes and elemental distributions can be defined as well as a wide range of irradiation conditions including non-uniform beam profiles. The paper addresses details of the involved algorithms and discusses potential artifacts with respect to surface sputtering, broadening of compositional profiles, and surface contours.

Mn2+:ZnO nanocrystals were prepared by a hydrolysis and condensation reaction in DMSO under atmospheric conditions. Synthesis was monitored by electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Zn(OAc)2 was found to strongly inhibit oxidation of Mn2+ by O2, allowing the synthesis of Mn2+:ZnO to be performed aerobically. Mn2+ ions were removed from the surfaces of as-prepared nanocrystals using dodecylamine to yield high-quality internally doped Mn2+:ZnO colloids of nearly spherical shape and uniform diameter (6.1 ± 0.7 nm). Simulations of the highly resolved X- and Q-band nanocrystal EPR spectra, combined with quantitative analysis of magnetic susceptibilities, confirmed that the manganese is substitutionally incorporated into the ZnO nanocrystals as Mn2+ with very homogeneous speciation, differing from bulk Mn2+:ZnO only in the magnitude of D-strain. Robust ferromagnetism was observed in spin-coated thin films of the nanocrystals, with 300 K saturation moments as large as 1.35 ?B/Mn2+ and TC {\textgreater} 350 K. A distinct ferromagnetic resonance signal was observed in the EPR spectra of the ferromagnetic films. The occurrence of ferromagnetism in Mn2+:ZnO and its dependence on synthetic variables are discussed in the context of these and previous theoretical and experimental results.},

The present empirical formula is found to be very useful for preliminary descriptions of the angular dependence of sputtering yield. This work was carried out under the collaborating Research Program at the Institute of Plasma Physics, Nagoya University. Lindhard's theory of the nuclear stopping power is developed to take into account the binding force between the lattice atoms of solids. It is shown that the nuclear stopping power is proportional to the velocity (not the energy) of the moving atom at the low velocity limit. Debye temperature dependence of the nuclear stopping power is discussed.},

When a surface is bombarded at locally oblique incidence the most pronounced sputtering effect is likely to be observed not at the very point of impact, but further “downstream”. This effect may cause a significant reduction of the local sputtering yield on top of a spike or a ridge, and an increase on the bottom of a groove or a crater. As a consequence, small irregularities on a relatively smooth surface may be enhanced during bombardment. It is concluded that a microscopically flat surface is unstable under high-dose ion bombardment unless atom migration acts as a dominating smoothing effect. Conversely, sharp cones appear to be surprisingly stable under bombardment. Even on a clean surface, cones erode more slowly than a plane surface, provided that their dimensions are of the order of, or less than, the penetration depth of the ions.},

We use Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulation to study this process, with 20 keV Ar impact on a-Si clusters as a prototypical example. The sputter yield is quantified as being influenced by oblique incidence and target curvature. Cluster radii R are scaled to the energy deposition depth, a. For large R (R/a{\textgreater}5) sphere sputtering follows closely the sputtering of planar targets, if the variation of the incidence angle on the sphere surface is taken into account. For smaller radii, the yield increases due to the influence of curvature. For radii R/a≲1 pronounced forward sputtering leads to a maximum in the sputter yield. For smaller R, sputter emission becomes isotropic, but decreases in magnitude since not all the projectile energy is deposited in the sphere. However, for all spheres studied (R≥0.05a) the average sputter yield is larger than for infinitely large spheres (R→∞). A simple model based on linear collision cascade theory and assuming that the energy deposition profile is independent of the sphere size predicts sputtering for large spheres well, but fails for small spheres where it strongly underestimates sputtering. The MC data for the smaller spheres are supplemented by MD calculations, which indicate a significant additional contribution caused by spike sputtering.},

These measurements provide information about density changes and plastic phenomena in the implanted region. Experiments were performed for a variety of ions, a range of fluxes, and for temperatures between −175 and 200 °C. In all cases, the implanted region expanded due to the creation of damaged crystal, creating compressive stress in the implanted region on the order of 108 N/m2. Once heavily damaged or amorphous regions were formed, radiation‐enhanced plastic flow of material out of the plane of the wafer occurred in order to relieve the stress created by the expansion. The value of the shear viscosity responsible for this phenomena could be measured by comparing samples with the same history but different stresses. For 2‐MeV Xe implantation at room temperature and 1011 ions/cm2 s, the radiation‐enhanced shear viscosity is ∼ 1013 Ns/m2, which is at least four orders of magnitude smaller than the thermally activated shear viscosity. Possible contributions to flow from a homogeneous distribution of broken bonds and from fluid‐like collision cascade regions are discussed.},

	abstract = {Swift heavy-ion irradiation of amorphous materials causes nonsaturating plastic deformation. Thin samples deform anisotropically as if they were hammered. Thick samples or thin layers on top of thick crystalline substrates flow plastically during nonperpendicular irradiations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the constitutive equation of ion hammering not only describes the homogeneous flow of uniformly irradiated matter but also the deformation effects at boundaries between irradiated and unirradiated matter. An analytic expression is derived which describes the flow of thin surface layers in the vicinity of an abrupt boundary. This solution is complemented by finite-element calculations, which reveal the influence of finite transition widths. The constitutive equation is also solved numerically to unveil the boundary effects for thick samples, where the ion-induced deformation depends on the distance from the specimen surface. The calculations are compared with experiments carried out with thin amorphous silicon surface layers and thick crown glasses. The excellent agreement confirms the validity of the constitutive equation and supports its microscopic basis, namely the idea of an efficient relaxation of thermally induced shear stresses along the ion path during the thermal spike period.},

The results show that the crystal structure has a strong effect on many aspects of damage production, while other material characteristics are of lesser overall importance. In all materials studied, isolated point defects produced by the cascade are predominantly interstitials. In semiconductors, amorphous clusters are produced in the cascade core, whereas in metals most of the crystal regenerates, leaving only small vacancy-rich clusters. Large interstitial clusters found in a few events in the heavy metals were observed to form by the isolation of a high-density liquid zone during the recrystallization phase of a cascade.},

It is widely believed that the amorphous–liquid transition is a first-order melting transition. In contrast to this, recent computer simulations and the experimental observation of pressure-induced amorphization of nanoporous silicon have revived the idea of an underlying liquid–liquid phase transition implying the existence of a low-density liquid and its glass transition to the amorphous solid. Here we demonstrate that during irradiation with high-energy heavy ions amorphous silicon deforms plastically in the same way as conventional glasses. This behaviour provides experimental evidence for the existence of the low-density liquid. The glass transition temperature for a timescale of 10 picoseconds is estimated to be about 1,000 K. Our results support the idea of liquid polymorphism as a general phenomenon in tetrahedral networks.},

	abstract = {Ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si has attracted significant interest since the beginning of the use of ion implantation for the fabrication of Si devices. A number of theoretical calculations and experiments were designed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the crystal-to-amorphous transition in Si . Nowadays, a renewed interest in the modeling of amorphization mechanisms at atomic level has arisen due to the use of preamorphizing implants and high dopantimplantation doses for the fabrication of nanometric-scale Si devices. In this paper we will describe the most significant experimental observations related to the ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si and the models that have been developed to describe the process. Amorphous Si formation by ion implantation is the result of a critical balance between the damage generation and its annihilation. Implantation cascades generate different damage configurations going from isolated point defects and point defect clusters in essentially crystalline Si to amorphous pockets and continuous amorphous layers. The superlinear trend in the damage accumulation with dose and the existence of an ion mass depending critical temperature above which it is not possible to amorphize are some of the intriguing features of the ion-beam-induced amorphization in Si . Phenomenological models were developed in an attempt to explain the experimental observations, as well as other more recent atomistic models based on particular defects. Under traditional models, amorphization is envisaged to occur through the overlap of isolated damaged regions created by individual ions (heterogeneous amorphization) or via the buildup of simple defects (homogeneous amorphization). The development of atomistic amorphization models requires the identification of the lattice defects involved in the amorphization process and the characterization of their annealing behavior. Recently, the amorphization model based on the accumulation and interaction of bond defects or IV pairs has been shown to quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations. Current understanding of amorphous Si formation and its recrystallization, predictive capabilities of amorphization models, and residual damage after regrowth are analyzed.},

	abstract = {Track formation due to high electronic energy deposition during swift heavy ion irradiation is well known in insulating materials as well as in some intermetallic compounds and metals. In semiconductors the physical situation was much less clear, and only during the last few years several experimental results on the effect of high electronic energy deposition were published, which are summarised and discussed in the present paper. Like in insulators, swift heavy ion irradiation may cause amorphous tracks in some semiconductors, such as InP, InSb, InAs, GaSb and Ge, if a certain value of the electronic energy deposition E, per ion and unit length characteristic for the material and the ion is exceeded. The critical values of e, are much higher than in the other materials, and the corresponding ion energies are close to the maximum ion energies available with the existing high energy accelerators. On the other hand, with cluster ions, as e.g. C-60, tracks are easily formed in Si, Ge and GaAs with ion energies of several tens of MeV. Beside damage and track formation, annealing of damage was observed in the semiconductors, and it can be concluded that the effect of high electronic energy deposition represents itself as a competition between damage formation and annealing. Which of the two processes dominates is mainly determined by the electronic energy deposition. Qualitatively the observed behaviour can be explained in the framework of the thermal spike model. However, a quantitative description of all data available is not successful in the framework of this concept. This is obviously due to the fact that the effects are influenced not only by the electronic energy deposition, but also by a variety of other parameters, such as the ion velocity, the ion mass, the charge state of the impinging ions and the radial distribution of the electronic energy around the ions' path, All these parameters have to be taken into account within a theoretical description. However, the present situation is characterised by a lack of sufficient experimental data, and further systematic work is required to make progress in this interesting field. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, these luminescent centres in bulk diamond crystals have the disadvantage of low photon out-coupling. Here, we demonstrate a single-photon source composed of a nitrogen-vacancy centre in a diamond nanowire, which produces ten times greater flux than bulk diamond devices, while using ten times less power.

In this work, we demonstrate the reversible manipulation of the charge state of a single NV center from NV? across NV0 to a nonfluorescent, dark state by using an all-diamond in-plane gate nanostructure. Applying a voltage to the in-plane gate structure can influence the energy band bending sufficiently for charge state conversion of NV centers. These diamond in-plane structures can function as transparent top gates, enabling the distant control of the charge state of NV centers tens of micrometers away from the nanostructure.},

For Pt particles with diameters 5–20 nm, the depth of the embedding increases with an ion dose until the particles are fully submerged at a dose of ∼10 16 cm −2 . The results are explained by capillary driving forces and an ion-induced viscousflow of amorphous SiO 2 . The irradiation-induced viscosity of SiO 2 needed to explain our results is ∼0.9×10 23 Pa ion cm −2 , consistent with previous measurements using stress relaxation. Similar results are obtained for 10 keV He + irradiation, suggesting that ion-induced viscosity arises from localized defects rather than from the creation of large melt zones.

We devote the most attention to 1D nanostructures that have been synthesized in relatively copious quantities using chemical methods. We begin this article with an overview of synthetic strategies that have been exploited to achieve 1D growth. We then elaborate on these approaches in the following four sections: i) anisotropic growth dictated by the crystallographic structure of a solid material; ii) anisotropic growth confined and directed by various templates; iii) anisotropic growth kinetically controlled by supersaturation or through the use of an appropriate capping reagent; and iv) new concepts not yet fully demonstrated, but with long-term potential in generating 1D nanostructures. Following is a discussion of techniques for generating various types of important heterostructured nanowires. By the end of this article, we highlight a range of unique properties (e.g., thermal, mechanical, electronic, optoelectronic, optical, nonlinear optical, and field emission) associated with different types of 1D nanostructures. We also briefly discuss a number of methods potentially useful for assembling 1D nanostructures into functional devices based on crossbar junctions, and complex architectures such as 2D and 3D periodic lattices. We conclude this review with personal perspectives on the directions towards which future research on this new class of nanostructured materials might be directed.},

As a monitor for single-vacancy production, the Si-B1 center due to the oxygen-vacancy pair was used. Over the energy range 0.7-1.5 MeV, the divacancy production rate rises a factor of 7 while the single-vacancy rate rises only a factor of 1.5, reflecting a higher threshold for divacancy production, as expected. Also presented are data on the dependence of the divacancy production rate on the orientation of the crystal axes with respect to the incident beam and on the resulting anisotropy of the divacancy orientation in the lattice.

	abstract = {Spherical SiO2 and ZnS colloidal particles show a dramatic anisotropic plastic deformation under 4 MeV Xe ion irradiation, that changes their shape into oblate ellipsoidal, with an aspect ratio that can be precisely controlled by the ion fluence. The 290 nm and 1.1 μm diameter colloids were deposited on a Si substrate and irradiated at 90 K, using fluences in the range 3×1013–8×1014 cm−2. The transverse particle diameter shows a linear increase with ion fluence, while the longitudinal diameter shrinks; the particle volume remains constant. Size aspect ratios up to 3.1 are achieved. Applications of the ion beam deformation technique are shown in studies of liquid crystalline colloidal ordering, self-assembled two-dimensional colloidal lithographic masks for thin-film deposition, and in tuning the optical properties of three-dimensional colloidal crystals.},

This value is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude compared to the same irradiation of flat Au surfaces. Using MD simulations, we show that the very high yield can be understood as a combination of enhanced yields due to low incoming angles at the sides of the nanowire, as well as the high surface-to-volume ratio causing enhanced explosive sputtering from heat spikes. We also find, both in experiments and simulations, that channeling has a strong effect on the sputtering yield: if the incoming beam happens to be aligned with a crystal axis of the nanorod, the yield can decrease to about 100.},

For H the electronic stopping power S is found to exhibit the expected velocity proportionality at low ion velocities, which confirms the anticipated excitation mechanisms responsible for the energy transfer between ions and the electrons in the solid. In contrast, for He, S shows a clear deviation from velocity proportionality for both materials at ion velocities below 0.8 atomic units, i.e., 64 keV. This result indicates a change in the interaction mechanisms active at the investigated ion velocities, which cannot exclusively be interpreted from the density of states of the target. Instead, the more complex electronic structure of the He ion enables an additional energy loss channel due to charge exchange by atomic level promotion. Associated energy losses together with a changed equilibrium charge state permit an explanation of the observed phenomenon.},

The sputter yield is increased for impact on convex surfaces. The influence of surface curvature along the incident-ion azimuth and perpendicular to it are discussed separately. Our analytical results are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations for the specific case of 20 keV Ar ion impact on a cylindrical nanowire consisting of amorphous silicon.

By varying the growth temperature we found a maximum in the whisker growth rate at about 450–475°C. With increasing temperature the growth rate decreases due to competing growth at the (1̄ 1̄ 1̄) substrate surface and at the \{1 1 0\} whisker side facets, which leads to significant tapering of the whiskers. For low temperatures, the growth rate R in the ln R=f(1/T)-plot results in an Arrhenius activation energy of about 67–75 kJ/mol, a value which is in agreement with activation energies reported for low-temperature planar growth of GaAs from TMG and AsH3. The Au acts as a local catalyst and as a collector of reactants, enabling a liquid-phase-epitaxy-like growth with high growth rates at the GaAs (1̄ 1̄ 1̄)B/(Au,Ga) interface.},

	abstract = {A review and expansion of the fundamental processes of the vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth mechanism for nanowires is presented. Although the focus is on nanowires, most of the concepts may be applicable to whiskers, nanotubes, and other unidirectional growth. Important concepts in the VLS mechanism such as preferred deposition, supersaturation, and nucleation are examined. Nanowire growth is feasible using a wide range of apparatuses, material systems, and growth conditions. For nanowire growth the unidirectional growth rate must be much higher than growth rates of other surfaces and interfaces. It is concluded that a general, system independent mechanism should describe why nanowires grow faster than the surrounding surfaces. This mechanism is based on preferential nucleation at the interface between a mediating material called the collector and a crystalline solid. The growth conditions used mean the probability of nucleation is low on most of the surfaces and interfaces. Nucleation at the collector-crystal interface is however different and of special significance is the edge of the collector-crystal interface where all three phases meet. Differences in nucleation due to different crystallographic interfaces can occur even in two phase systems. We briefly describe how these differences in nucleation may account for nanowire growth without a collector. Identifying the mechanism of nanowire growth by naming the three phases involved began with the naming of the VLS mechanism. Unfortunately this trend does not emphasize the important concepts of the mechanism and is only relevant to one three phase system. We therefore suggest the generally applicable term preferential interface nucleation as a replacement for these different names focusing on a unifying mechanism in nanowire growth.},

The nanostructure defines the crystallographic orientation of the solidifying Au droplet. Possible alloy, intermetallic, or eutectic phase formation during catalysis are elucidated with the help of a proposed ternary Au-Zn-O phase diagram.},

Reference data were taken from experiments if available, or computed by self-consistent total-energy calculations within the local density-functional theory otherwise. For fitting the parameters, only structural data of the metallic phases of gallium and arsenide as well as those of different GaAs phases were used. A number of tests on point defect properties, surface properties, and melting behavior have been performed afterward in order to validate the accuracy and transferability of the potential model, but were not part of the fitting procedure. While point defect properties and surfaces with low As content are found to be in good agreement with literature data, the description of As-rich surface reconstructions is not satisfactory.

	abstract = {Following a description used to explain a phase transformation observed after pulsed femtosecond laser irradiation, a transient thermal process is used to describe latent-track formation after high electronic excitation induced by energetic (GeV) heavy ions. The transient thermal calculation is restricted to the amorphous materials a-Ge, a-Si, and a-Fe85B15, for which nearly all latent-track radii and/or macroscopic thermodynamic properties are known. The heat-flow equation is solved numerically in cylindrical geometry. The time-dependent heat-generation term is assumed to be due to the electron-atom interaction. The characteristic length λ of the energy transport by secondary electrons is taken as the only free parameter and the maximum diameter of the cylinder of liquid matter is considered as the diameter of the observed latent track. Using the single value λ=14 nm, we have been able to calculate these diameters in a-Si and a-Ge in reasonable agreement with experimental track diameters, taking into account the large differences between the macroscopic thermodynamic parameters of both materials. This λ value is less than that for the crystalline state. In the case of a-Fe85B15, the diameters calculated with use of λ=19 nm are in agreement with the ones determined recently by electrical-resistivity change.},

	abstract = {In recent years many groups have advocated a thermal-spike model to explain a variety of experimental results in ion-irradiation of solids, as for example sputtering, mixing, compositional change, structural change, and track formation. The latter include crystal-to-amorphous transitions as well as track formation due to MeV/u particles. In this paper we reconsider the phenomena occurring during ion impact of solids looking at the time scale generally indicated as relevant for thermal-spike effects, namely a picosecond scale as shown by molecular dynamics. Sputtering, mixing, and track formation, however, will be analyzed in more detail. We consider first ion-beam sputtering and reiterate (as is already well-known) that yields which increase with the bulk temperature most often indicate merely the onset of normal vaporization. Indeed, only simulations appear to be capable of giving insight even if the information is sometimes tentative. In mixing, ballistic transport is important but not dominant. It is often argued that the additional transport is provided by thermal spikes but it is noted that such an assumption is normally not required by the experimental results. What is more relevant is a role for residual defects such that the total diffusion flux includes (if the defects are chemically guided) a modified Darken factor, or (if the defects are not chemically guided) simply an increased diffusivity. The time scale (min), distances (well beyond the collision cascade), temperature sensitivity (changes of as little as 75 K are relevant), and correlation with vacancy properties (thence with the solid rather than liquid state) which are relevant to these residual defects are not understandable in terms of thermal spikes. We finally consider track formation. Recent work claiming that track formation in solids, irradiated with heavy ions, may be understood in terms of thermal spikes is reconsidered to show that the thermal-spike model is utilized without considering all the relevant phenomena included in irradiation-induced heating and phase transitions. For example, a comparison of fs-laser pulse irradiation of Si with swift heavy-ion irradiation, shows that melting is possible in the first case since the excited electrons have a low and more or less restricted energy while in the case of swift ion-irradiation, the motion of the excited electrons includes a ballistic component which does not favour the localization of the thermal energy necessary to induce lattice melting. It is concluded that track formation is better understandable in a more general framework of defect-induced processes in solids.},

	abstract = {A Monte Carlo program for the simulation of ion beam analysis data is presented. It combines mainly four features: (i) ion slowdown is computed separately from the main scattering/recoil event, which is directed towards the detector. (ii) A virtual detector, that is, a detector larger than the actual one can be used, followed by trajectory correction. (iii) For each collision during ion slowdown, scattering angle components are extracted form tables. (iv) Tables of scattering angle components, stopping power and energy straggling are indexed using the binary representation of floating point numbers, which allows logarithmic distribution of these tables without the computation of logarithms to access them. Tables are sufficiently fine-grained that interpolation is not necessary. Ion slowdown computation thus avoids trigonometric, inverse and transcendental function calls and, as much as possible, divisions. All these improvements make possible the computation of 107 collisions/s on current PCs. Results for transmitted ions of several masses in various substrates are well comparable to those obtained using SRIM-2006 in terms of both angular and energy distributions, as long as a sufficiently large number of collisions is considered for each ion. Examples of simulated spectrum show good agreement with experimental data, although a large detector rather than the virtual detector has to be used to properly simulate background signals that are due to plural collisions.

	abstract = {Single and dual-beam ion irradiations of silicon carbide (SiC) were performed to study possible Synergetic effects between Nuclear (S-n) and Electronic (S-e) Energy Losses. Results obtained combining Rutherford backscattering in channeling conditions, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques show that dual-beam irradiation of SiC induces a dramatic change in the final sample microstructure with a substantial decrease of radiation damage as compared to single-beam irradiation. Actually, a defective layer containing dislocations is formed upon dual-beam irradiation (S-n\&S-e), whereas single low-energy irradiation (S-n alone) or even sequential (S-n + S-e) irradiations lead to full amorphization. The healing process is ascribed to the electronic excitation arising from the electronic energy loss of swift ions. These results shed new light on the long-standing puzzling problem of the existence of a possible synergy between S-n and Se in ion-irradiation experiments. This work is interesting for both fundamental understanding of the ion-solid interactions and technological applications in the nuclear industry where recovery S-n/S-e effects may preserve the integrity of nuclear devices.

These can potentially yield almost everything there is to know about the 3-D elemental composition of types of samples that have always been hard to analyse, given the sensitivity and the spacial resolution of the techniques used. Molecular and chemical information is available in principle with, respectively, MeV-SIMS and high resolution PIXE. However, these techniques separately give only partial information - the secret of "Total IBA" is to find synergies between techniques used simultaneously which efficiently give extra information.

We find that DFT calculations utilizing numerical basis sets and HF calculations using decontracted standard basis sets provide repulsive potentials which are significantly improved compared to the standard universal ZBL potential. The accuracy of the calculated potentials is almost totally governed by the duality of the one-particle basis set.

Also multielement and multilayer targets, even complex geometries, can be treated exactly in order to simulate realistic cases.

The present paper will concentrate mainly on sputtering calculations with the Monte Carlo code TRIM, which treats ion and recoil transport in amorphous matter. It is based — as are analytic theories and most other Monte Carlo codes — on binary collisions with target atoms initially at rest. Over the past few years, the basic physical input has been greatly improved. Both the interatomic potentials and the electronic stopping powers proved to be of crucial importance even for the lowest energies occurring in recoil cascades. With the Kr-C or universal potential and the recent ZBL electronic stopping, which includes the Z oscillations, and a planar surface binding energy set equal to the heat of sublimation, realistic sputtering predictions could be obtained for most metals — without the use of any adjustable parameters.},

We have calculated interatomic potentials from first principles in the free-electron approximation for 14 diatomic interactions representing light particles incident on heavy targets (M1≪M2), self-irradiation (M1=M2), and heavy particles on light targets (M1≫M2). The potentials were approximated by a Molière-like form and the parameters tabulated for general covenience. The classical orbit equation was integrated numerically for bare potentials and the scattering cross section, stopping power, range, and straggling calculated. Simple three-parameter expressions for the stopping power are given which are directly integrable to obtain the range. The results are in reasonable agreement with experiment for a representative Kr-C potential and agree within 10\% for an average potential derived from the free-electron calculations.},

We investigate the pattern formation on amorphous carbon thin films irradiated with Xe ions of energies between 200 eV and 10 keV. Sputter yield as well as number of displacements within the collision cascade vary strongly as function of ion energy and allow us to investigate the contributions of curvature-dependent erosion according to the Bradley-Harper model as well as mass redistribution according to the Carter-Vishnyakov model. We find parallel ripple orientations for an ion incidence angle of 60° and for all energies. A transition to perpendicular pattern orientation or a rather flat surface occurs around 80° for energies between 1 keV and 10 keV. Our results are compared with calculations based on both models. For the calculations we extract the shape and size of Sigmund's energy ellipsoid (parameters a, σ, μ), the angle-dependent sputter yield, and the mean mass redistribution distance from the Monte Carlo simulations with program SDTrimSP. The calculated curvature coefficients Sx and Sy describing the height evolution of the surface show that mass redistribution is dominant for parallel pattern formation in the whole energy regime. Furthermore, the angle where the parallel pattern orientation starts to disappear is related to curvature-dependent sputtering. In addition, we investigate the case of Pt erosion with 200 eV Ne ions, where mass redistribution vanishes. In this case, we observe perpendicular ripple orientation in accordance with curvature-dependent sputtering and the predictions of the Bradley-Harper model.},
