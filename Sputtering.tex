\section{First results in $Mn$ irradiated $GaAs$}

Introduction by Mn in GaAs (JPhysD)

When an energetic ion hits a solid target the ensuing collision cascade will displace some of the target atoms from their original positions. The energy lost by the ion in these collisions is called ``nuclear'' energy loss. A displaced target atom can either become an interstitial, if it stays within the target volume, or be sputtered if it has sufficient energy to leave the solid. The energy required to leave the target is the surface-binding-energy.
